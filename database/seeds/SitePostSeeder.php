Here are four painless and easy tips to save money without sacrificing your lifestyle!', 'excerpt' => 'It is no secret, however, that your first years as an independent adult can also be very challenging from a financial standpoint.', 'body' => '<div id=\"it5h\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div><section id=\"i957\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></section><p id=\"istg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"ix1f\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">It is often said that your 20&#039;s are the best years of your life. Most are finishing school and stepping into the real world of responsibilities. When you are young you have a blank slate, with the opportunity to craft your future in whatever direction calls to you. It is no secret, however, that your first years as an independent adult can also be very challenging from a financial standpoint. You are likely just learning to budget your money, which, chances are, you don&#039;t have a lot of yet anyways. </div><p id=\"iy8u\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><p id=\"ixnl\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"ia3mz\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">As with most aspects of growing up, lessons typically have to be learned the hard way before they stick. That doesn\'t have to be the case for you, though, which is why I\'ve put together a list of the biggest lessons I learned on my journey to financial security. Here are five things I wish I knew earlier regarding money and how to keep more of it in your pocket while you are still young and establishing yourself. </div><p id=\"ia29\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><h2 id=\"iash\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Learn To Cook </h2><p id=\"ih8g\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"ii2lf\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Eating out at restaurants should be seen as a luxury reserved for celebrating something special. Frequent trips to the grocery store and a refrigerator full of options are not only significantly cheaper than eating out but will leave you feeling better, too! Knowing how to cook and being comfortable in the kitchen is an excellent life skill. The best way to do this is to start establishing a weekly grocery budget, as well as tallying how much money you spend every week eating out at restaurants. If you can reduce the dollars you are spending outside your house and put half of that money into your grocery fund you’ll be setting yourself up to buy in bulk and save money, too. </div><p id=\"iwrox\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><h2 id=\"ispx9\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Avoid Bar Tabs</h2><p id=\"ii8bl\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"ijxch\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Alcohol can be effective for relieving stress and helping you unwind after a long day or week. Still, there are few things more anxiety producing and bad for your budget than racking up an unnecessary bar tab. There\'s nothing wrong with enjoying a few cold ones, but try to keep the majority of your refreshments stored in your refrigerator at home. If you feel you are missing the social aspect of drinking at a bar with friends, don’t forget that it’s totally reasonable (and a lot of fun!) to host the party! If you have reasonable friends they might even be willing to foot the bill for alcohol if you are willing to host the party and clean up after everyone leaves. This is a small price to pay for having all of your drinking fun without any of the expense! </div><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><h2 id=\"iuiap\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Drive A Beater </h2><p id=\"il5ug\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"iq6ev\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">This one doesn\'t sound flashy and cool, and in a sense, it\'s not. When you are young it\'s a waste of money to commit yourself to a large car payment on the hopes that you will impress somebody. The truth is nobody cares what car you drive, especially when you are young, and spending hundreds a month on a car that will only depreciate is unnecessary. If you are interested in prioritizing your budget, and therefore your future, when it comes to buying a car a good rule of thumb I’ve always followed is the 10x100,000 rule, meaning either 10 years old or 100,000 miles plus. Additionally, look for reliable brand used cars that operate with simple mechanics, and have modest engines, as this cuts down on your insurance costs too!Saving your money now will allow you to buy cool cars later. (when you can afford them!) </div><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><h2 id=\"iut0b\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Brew Your Own </h2><p id=\"igkvn\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><div id=\"iekhm\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The five dollars you spend on coffee every morning may not seem like much, but in reality, it adds up. If you drink coffee most mornings, that five-dollar cup can quickly add up to an additional car payment by the end of the month. Brewing your coffee is not only significantly more affordable, but it can be fun too! Use it as an opportunity to try new beans and brewing techniques, culture yourself! </div><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><p id=\"il83x\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Establishing great spending habits when you are young will not only reduce the stresses of a tight budget now, but will set you up for success down the road. In life there are few things more important than being accountable to yourself and taking charge of your decisions. The money you save today will set you up to chase your dreams tomorrow. Avoid the temptation of spending satisfaction and stay focused, your hard work will pay off down the road, and you\'ll be happy you did! </p>', 'image_id' => 1],

If so, you should know that you are far from alone. The truth is that many young people struggle with finding financial stability and don\'t know where to start. Managing your money and setting yourself up for financial security down the line isn\'t taught in schools and is hardly glorified by pop culture. Even still, it is one of the most critical lessons in adulting, and by mastering it, you will give yourself a leg up on being able to do the things you want in life later on down the road. </div></div><div id=\"i7sz\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"i94g\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><div id=\"i0bn\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"ia6g\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"iyv6f\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Here are the most important things you can do for yourself now to avoid the anxiety of bad finances down the road. </div></div><div id=\"iuus9\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"isque\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ifh8\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></h2><h2 draggable=\"false\" data-highlightable=\"1\" id=\"i71p\" class=\"gjs-selected\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Secure Reliable Income</h2><div id=\"islg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"if2yk\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"i010f\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The first step to finding financial security may seem obvious but is overlooked by many. Finding a stable income in a field that will exist five and ten years from now allows you to start reliably taking in income and, more importantly, saving. By working a dead-end job that would be hard to replace, you expose yourself to the risk of being unemployed if something were to happen at your current position. This creates a potential scenario where you would need to spend any savings you do have, or worse, rack up debt to stay afloat while you find something new. Find a reliable career path and avoid this issue down the road.</div><div id=\"igmqm\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"iyxs3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><div id=\"igohm\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"i2wzh\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><h2 id=\"i2hu\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></h2><h2 draggable=\"false\" data-highlightable=\"1\" id=\"ilzx\" class=\"gjs-selected\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"ij5ma\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Live Below Your Means</div></h2><div id=\"i9ax\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"it6z5\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"i0ris\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">This is perhaps the hardest lesson to learn but is critically important. If your expenses are preventing you from saving a decent chunk of your income each month, it\'s time to make some sacrifices. By living below your means now you set yourself up to save money and invest. Drive a BMW now, and a beater later, or vice versa? You decide...</div></div><div id=\"ii685\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"isprh\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><h2 id=\"i8b5h\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></h2><h2 draggable=\"false\" data-highlightable=\"1\" id=\"i9kef\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Pay Off Debts</h2><div id=\"iszxq\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"i10k9\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"ib60s\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">There\'s nothing worse than the feeling of debt looming over you, especially if that debt is accumulating interest. Give yourself a clean slate and work towards paying off your debts before you start saving. Start with the smallest ones first, building momentum before you tackle the larger ones. You\'ll be amazed at how fast they can be paid off if you commit to getting it done. If it feels like your debt is impossible to catch up on now, understand that the longer that it sits out there the less interested you will become in paying it. It’s important to take stock of exactly who and what you owe, and then come up with a clear and disciplined plan to rid yourself of the debt.</div></div><div id=\"iev99\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"i77qh\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ixygw\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Build Credit</h2><div id=\"ihqga\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"idx68\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"iaasg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Credit makes the world go around, and you will learn, if you haven\'t already, that it is critically important that you are seen as trustworthy by lenders. If your credit is poor, you suffer when it comes time to buying anything significant, such as a car or a home. Build your credit however you can. Secured credit cards and reporting your rent payments are an excellent place to start. </div></div><div id=\"i032i\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><br id=\"i3oqg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></div><h2 id=\"iq72f\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Pay Yourself First</h2></div><div id=\"imdyc\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div id=\"i4xma\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Commit to saving a percentage of your income every paycheck. Once you deposit it into a savings or investment account, work to keep it there at all costs. Dipping into your savings is a terrible money habit and can keep you from ever accumulating a nest egg. While it might initially seem counterproductive to pay yourself first and risk having your creditors breathe down your neck, it’s important to realize that without prioritizing yourself first it will be extremely difficult for you to actually get ahead. When you agree to a payment plan with a creditor, whether that be for a credit card or the rent on an apartment, make sure you have a clear understanding of how long you can actually go without paying. Often times the date they’d like you to pay and the date you must pay to avoid ramifications are different. Pay yourself first, then adjust your strategy elsewhere to stay afloat. </div></div><p id=\"iz4in\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Finding financial security can be one of the most freeing feelings in the world. It opens doors for you that would otherwise stay shut and allows you to pursue your dreams uninhibited by cost. Like anything building your financial security will take time and practice, but commit to it now and you will, without a doubt, thank yourself later. </p>', 'image_id' => 2],
   ['id' => 3, 'status' => 1, 'title' => 'Looking For A Realtor? | How To Find The Best Real Estate Rep', 'description' => 'When you are buying or selling a house, you have many options for a realtor. In this article, a former realtor explains what you should look for.', 'excerpt' => 'If you\'ve walked into an open house before, you\'ve likely realized that no shortage of agents that are eager and willing to help you.', 'body' => '<p id=\"i9p1\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Real estate can be an excellent investment for those willing to do their research and commit to a little patience. The potential for a low-risk investment that can produce substantial returns is realistic, but only with the proper groundwork to ensure you are getting the best deal. Luckily, the real estate industry is massive, and there is no shortage of professionals to walk you through every step of the process. If you imagine the group of professionals involved as a football team, your real estate agent is the quarterback. Your agent will help you navigate everything from securing the best rate for a home loan to scheduling showings and recommending inspectors, so choosing an excellent agent is critical to your buying experience. If you&#039;ve walked into an open house before, you&#039;ve likely realized that no shortage of agents that are eager and willing to help you. Like most industries, though, you should know that some are unquestionably better than others.</p><p id=\"iv2k\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">To help you avoid a real estate headache and ensure you can have confidence in your decision, we\'ve put together a few guidelines that will set you up for success! </p><h2 id=\"i0x2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">No Time For Family and Friends</h2><p id=\"ipu6\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The high commissions earned by agents who close the deal on a real estate transaction make it a very popular career choice for many. Chances are you have a friend or relative that has their real estate license and will be first in line to volunteer their services when it comes time to buy your first home. Perhaps you\'ve seen these solicitations on social media before? While supporting friends and family is a feel-good choice, real estate is not the time for warm and fuzzies. The truth is that a real estate transaction has a lot of moving parts and will likely be stressful at times. After all, for most, this will be the single largest financial transaction they make in their life. While initially it may make sense that you would want someone you can trust handling this, involving those people you are close to can muddy the water in times of stress. Having a non-bias representative that you aren\'t afraid to be assertive with will go a long way towards ensuring you get the best deal for yourself. </p><h2 id=\"iq0u\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Find a Local Expert</h2><p id=\"i5fv\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Having a working knowledge of contracts and understanding the many steps to a real estate transaction is undoubtedly a non-negotiable for any worthwhile agent. Equally valuable, however, is having a deep understanding of the local area. Even if you have lived in the area you wish to buy your entire life, the chances are that there are intricacies in the real estate market that only a local trained professional will be privy to. Trends in the property values of specific neighborhoods, as well as a working relationship with the other agents in the area, will leave you with the best chances of finding the best deal. Often local agents will also have prior knowledge of properties sold off-market and not advertised in any of the usual channels. All of the experience in the world doesn\'t replace having the inside scoop! </p><h2 id=\"iy7g\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Look for the Hungry Agent</h2><p id=\"il3w\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">When you are relying on a real estate agent to represent you during a real estate transaction, it’s important to understand that there is actually quite a bit of work involved. It’s often assumed that real estate agents make a ton of money without having to do much more than take care of a couple contracts, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. While they are in charge of making sure all of your contracts are correct in representing your best interests, they also take the reins on finding properties for you, scheduling tours, and negotiating back and forth on aspects of the transaction such as cost and contingencies. All of these critical steps can be accomplished with full attention or half attention, so it’s important that you can trust your agent is committed to doing the absolute best job they can for you. The best agents will treat your transaction as an opportunity to prove their worth and become your realtor for life; make sure that’s who you are enlisting to help you! </p><p id=\"ixma\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">By following these guidelines you can be confident that the agent you find will work hard for you to find the best deal possible and will succeed in doing so. Real estate is an excellent investment, but only if you make your decision with all the available insight and have your transaction appropriately executed at all levels by an unbiased and capable agent.

Here are four quick and easy ways to make money online without having to commit to a second job!', 'excerpt' => 'Luckily, the age of the internet has opened a whole new set of opportunities for those looking to make some extra cash on the side.', 'body' => '<p>There are many reasons people find themselves broke and in need of extra money. Whether it be the holidays, a few too many rounds at the bar last weekend, or saving for a big vacation, having more money to spend is something everyone comes across the desire for at least once in their life. (and usually far more frequently!) The problem for most people begins with the fact that we already work a full schedule! With the commitments of our primary income source, along with the hobbies and activities that keep us happy and healthy, there often isn\'t enough predictable and structured time in our schedules to pick up a second job somewhere. </p><br/><p>Luckily, the age of the internet has opened a whole new set of opportunities for those looking to make some extra cash on the side. As someone with a history full of entrepreneurial tendencies, I can honestly say I\'ve tried all sorts of ways to scrape some extra funds. Here are the best strategies I\'ve found to bring in additional income on the side without the commitment of a second job. Pick one or two from the list below and give it a shot. I know you\'ll be pleasantly surprised! </p><br/><h2>Garage Sale Hunting </h2><br/><p>Made famous by marketing mogul Gary Vaynerchuck, garage sale hunting is an excellent way to make extra cash. The power of the internet allows anyone with a smartphone to quickly look up the resale value on pretty much anything they see. Gary V has an excellent YouTube series (which he also monetizes for money!) that follows him as he bounces around garage sales, scooping up everything from hot wheels collections to old stuffed animals. As he rides off in the back of his Escalade, his assistants are sitting in the back posting the items and delivering the good news that he will make hundreds or thousands of dollars on resale. Obviously if you know Gary V you know that he doesn’t need the money, but he’s trying to make you realize just how easy it is.  Some apps even enable you to do so by scanning the UPC. Luckily, most garage sale organizers are more interested in getting rid of the things they perceive as junk to realize they are selling some of their stuff for far cheaper than it\'s worth! Buy low, and (re)sell high; it\'s the oldest trick in the book! </p><br/><h2>Retail Arbitrage </h2><br/><p>Have you ever walked into a smaller, local business and seen a deal that made your jaw drop? Often it\'s these \"little guys\" that slash prices the most, not the big chain stores. Make a habit of jumping on closeout sales at your local mom and pop stores; they often sell their inventory at a loss to free up money for other orders. These items can be resold on sites like eBay and Amazon for closer to their original price, allowing you to rake in a healthy profit!</p><br/><h2>Clean Your Garage </h2><br/><p>Chances are you have a lot of stuff you don\'t use much. It\'s the American way, after all! By liquidating the things you no longer need, you avoid them collecting dust and losing additional value. A weekend activity as easy as cleaning out your garage can bring hundreds of dollars your way, if not more. Use apps like Offerup to sell locally and save the hassle of shipping! One tip with Offerup, especially if you have a large pile of stuff to sell, is that you should never turn down a willing buyer. The unfortunate fact is that a relatively high number of “committed” buyers will fall through before you ever see cash in hand, so keep your options open! If you had someone lined up for three days from now, and you happen to get a second offer from someone that can come later that day, take the money and run!</p><br/><h2>Create Content Online And Profit </h2><br/><p>Do you have any hobbies? Anything you are interested in that you could talk about forever without much additional research that other people might be looking for information about online? Create content and watch your bank account grow! Platforms like YouTube and Google Adsense allow you to make money off of your content, which you can post for very little money! </p><br/><br/><p>These are just a few ways I\'ve had success making money without having to commit to a second job. The beauty of the internet is that there are countless ways to bring in extra money without having to overbook your schedule. Commit yourself to one or two strategies and give them a shot, you\'ll be happy you did! </p>', 'image_id' => 4],
   ['id' => 5, 'status' => 1, 'title' => 'Invest In The Best | Maximizing Your Real Estate Investment', 'description' => 'Real Estate Investment can be a financial home run for your finances. Here\'s what a former realtor says are the three biggest things to look for!', 'excerpt' => 'Here are three tips to ensure that you make the smartest investment with your money that leaves you passively building wealth for years to come!', 'body' => '<p>Real estate has always been one of the most valuable assets someone can own. The fact that there is only a predetermined amount of space we have to split up between ourselves means that land and the homes and buildings on it will always be extraordinarily valuable. You would, in all likelihood, rather live next to the ocean on a private white sand beach than in an overcrowded area of town next to the city dump, right? Also, consider that our population is continually growing and our world globalizing, meaning that as time goes on, there will be less land available per person. Real estate will continue to be an excellent investment because of this, but where do you start? </p><br/><p>Here are three tips to ensure that you make the smartest investment with your money that leaves you passively building wealth for years to come!</p><br/><h2>Think Ahead </h2><br/><p>One of the best ways to find a great deal on real estate that will undoubtedly be a good investment of your time and money is to purchase land or housing in areas that border desirable regions but are not in and of themselves desirable. (yet!) This is a common strategy for many who are hoping to strike gold in their real estate investment but don\'t mistake that for meaning it\'s no longer a good idea. An excellent strategy is to keep an ear to the ground for significant events planned for a given area of town or even city. Major companies moving to a city can cause a considerable influx of affluent employees moving to the area that will all need space of their own. Simple supply and demand show that property values in the surrounding areas will increase as a result. The same goes for major construction, such as conference centers or stadiums!</p><br/><h2>Generate Income </h2><br/><p>The most significant gains in real estate investment come over more extended periods. This does not mean that you cannot generate income right away, though! Investing in multiple unit housing and retail space will pay you a monthly rent to occupy your space. The beauty of this is that you can use that monthly income to pay the mortgage on your loan or even reinvest elsewhere if you already own the property full and clear! Finding a property that can generate the monthly income needed to pay for itself leaves you in the driver seat to collect on the appreciation over time and capitalize on all of the principle you have paid towards your loan when it comes time to sell! </p><br/><h2>Patience Matters</h2><br/><p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of real estate investment is having the patience to ride out the storm when the market slows down. The real estate market operates on a relatively predictable growth cycle. Unfortunately, this means that there will be periods where property value growth slows or even depreciates. This is where it becomes critical that you have the patience, and ability, to ride out the storm. Over a long enough window it is an almost certainty that a smart investment will pay off, but cashing out early can make the difference between a brilliant decision and one that leaves you breaking even. (or worse!) </p><br/><p>On a more macro scale, it’s also critically important to consider the housing market as a whole. The fact of the matter is that the housing market will expand and contract over time; most real estate agents know this to be approximately every seven years. If you are able to buy when the market is contracted and prices are lower relative to overall lifetime value, you set yourself up for additional gains in the long term. Additionally, patience can pay when it comes to interest rates. Applying for a mortgage loan can be confusing, but one number you really need to understand is the interest rate and how it will affect your payment. It should become quickly obvious that a lower rate is advantageous because you pay less money in interest every month. Just like the real estate market, the financial markets have periods of higher and lower rates (on average). By using a bit of strategic patience here you can save yourself tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars! </p><br/><br/><p>Real estate investment is an excellent investment strategy; the returns can be massive, and it is also relatively safe if you\'ve planned correctly. With forethought and patience you can make a fortune without any additional work, providing security for you and your loved ones for many years to come! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 5],
   ['id' => 6, 'status' => 1, 'title' => 'Does Your Credit Need A Boost? | Credit Building How-To Guide', 'description' => 'Digging yourself out of bad or no credit history can be tough. Here are three easy tricks you are already doing that could be helping your score.', 'excerpt' => 'So, what steps can you take to build your credit from the ground up? Regardless of why your score is low, here are a few quick tips you can implement to gain some traction.', 'body' => '<p>If you\'ve spent time in the \"real world,\" you\'ve probably had your credit looked into for one reason or another. Whether for a car loan or to qualify as the tenant on a new apartment, the reality is that if you\'d like to take on additional financial responsibility, you\'ll need a proven track record. As you take on responsibilities, typically in the form of credit card bills and recurring payment loans, your credit (and trustworthiness) builds, and you see corresponding increases in your credit score. If you take on credit and fail to follow the agreed-upon payment schedule, you will see that reflected negatively in your score. </p><br/><p>We won\'t get into the weeds with how specifically the different bureaus calculate your score (there are three bureaus, each with individual scores), but, as general knowledge, you should know that scores range from 300-850 with a higher score being better. </p><br/><p>The credit reporting system was established to allow lenders and borrowers a platform of trust that can be built on and was created to work for the borrower, and not against them. The problem for many, however, is that when you don\'t have any credit, but you need credit to qualify for loans or responsibilities which build confidence, then it is easy to be stuck at the bottom. Likewise, if you have a poor credit history and have fallen short on your financial responsibilities in the past, it is often difficult to rebuild that trust with lenders. </p><br/><p>So, what steps can you take to build your credit from the ground up? Regardless of why your score is low, here are a few quick tips you can implement to gain some traction. </p><br/><h2>Find a Secured Credit Card </h2><br/><p>One thing you will find is that if you have bad or no credit, successfully getting approved for a credit card is nearly impossible. Unfortunately, using a credit card and then diligently paying it off is one of the fastest ways to build credit, which creates a bind for those at the bottom. A great strategy is to open up a secured credit card, which will be easier to get approved for as it is much lower risk than a traditional credit card. Secured cards work by tieing a checking account to the card and then having your monthly limit be decided based on the current balance of the account. This assures the lender that you can pay your bills and allows you to begin building a positive credit history. </p><br/><h2>Pay Your Student Loans</h2><br/><p>Student loans are prevalent among many young people, and neglecting to pay them can seriously ding your credit score. Start to pay these loans, however, and you will see it positively reflected in your score. There is no way out of student loans, even through bankruptcy, so it makes a lot of sense to prioritize the effort to pay them off. While I think it’s fairly indisputable that a world without student loans would make a lot of people happy, the reality is that they are a necessary evil for many young people who are looking to get ahead. Most people who carry student loans have a negative view towards their debt, and rightfully so, but by shifting this view to an opportunity to build credit it may reframe the situation in a way that makes the monthly bill more palatable. </p><br/><h2>Request Rent Reporting</h2><br/><p>Most credit bureaus don\'t take positive rental payment history into your credit score because most leasing companies and landlords do not report it. A solid history of paying rent on time can be an asset to your credit; however, so, especially when you are first building credit, it is beneficial to have your landlord report your payments. Rent is one of the nearly universal bills we all have to pay, so you might as well get credit for it! Especially when you consider the consequences of not paying your rent is a damaging eviction on your credit which can make it almost impossible to rent in the future, you would be foolish not to ensure this substantial financial liability is helping you as much as it can.

Check out these four tips to losing body fat without feeling like you are starving yourself!', 'excerpt' => 'Here are the most effective strategies I found to keep calories in check without feeling like you are starving yourself.', 'body' => '<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Today\'s culture has made being overweight and carrying around extra body fat something we are taught to feel shame about. Interestingly, packing on some extra pounds has also become more prevalent in our society than ever before. Unfortunately, the stigma that comes from carrying around excess body fat is primarily that it is the result of laziness and a lack of discipline. While this isn\'t necessarily true, it is important to understand that regardless of why someone may be overweight, they would be doing their health a favor by working on burning off some of their extra body fat. </p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The biggest limiting factor to losing body fat is that it is hard! Science has shown that a simple calorie deficit, or, eating fewer calories than your body is burning, is the yellow brick road to a more slim waistline, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s an easy feat! The food choices we are left to choose from as we navigate the craziness of our lives make keeping calories in check a real challenge. But, in the process of losing 95 pounds, I\'ve found that by following a few simple diet hacks, you can be well on your way to shedding the unwanted weight and feeling your best without sacrificing your sanity and feeling like you are starving. </p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Here are the most effective strategies I found to keep calories in check without feeling like you are starving yourself. </p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Substitute Low/No Cal Drink Options</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Liquid calories are a surefire way to sink your diet ship before you even really get started. Drinks like soda and alcohol can contain 2-300 calories in a single serving and will do nothing to make you feel more full. Often times, they can leave you feeling more thirsty than before you drank them, causing you to consume multiple servings in a truly disastrous negative feedback loop. Finding low calorie or, better, no-calorie options such as diet soda are a great way to get your fix without breaking the calorie bank. </p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Stick To Lean Proteins </h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Protein can be a fantastic food to rely on when you are trying to slim down. Not only is protein an essential macronutrient that is vital for your health, but it is satiating and works to curb your hunger. The issue lies in the fact that many proteins are also high in fat. Meats like pork and some cuts of beef can seem like a healthy choice but, in all actuality, are loaded with calories. Sticking to white fish, chicken, and lean beef (90% or leaner) will budget your calories effectively while still allowing you to enjoy the tasty, satiating satisfaction of eating meats. </p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Portion Your Feel-Goods</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The most effective diet in the world is not necessarily the one that limits your calories the most drastically. For any diet to be effective, you have to be consistent over the long haul; completely restricting your favorite calorie-dense foods is a recipe to tap out early. Allow yourself to enjoy the treats that make you feel good, just be sure to do your research and eat them in portions that allow you to manage your calories. </p><h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Plan Ahead</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Are you planning to go out for burgers and a beer for dinner? Whatever you do, don\'t cancel these fun plans for the sake of your diet. Completely cutting out the enjoyment that comes with food is setting yourself up for failure. Instead, recognize the higher calorie meals before they come, and plan ahead. Stick to lower-calorie foods during the day so you can enjoy your meals later, guilt-free. </p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Losing body fat can have a dramatic positive impact on your health and happiness. You will have more confidence, more energy, and the satisfaction of knowing that you accomplished something many try but few achieve. The best news is that you don\'t have to starve yourself to get results, stick to the guidelines above, and the rest will fall into place. </p>', 'image_id' => 7],

Here\'s the three most dangerous diet myths of 2020.', 'excerpt' => 'Here are the current trends in dieting that will set you up for failure.', 'body' => '<br/><p>Dieting advice is a dime a dozen, and the hyper-connectivity of the internet has put the accumulating heap of misleading weight loss anecdotes on overdrive. It seems that in 2020 everyone has the latest, least inconvenient way to lose weight and is equally quick to provide it to you (often behind an annoying paywall or newsletter signup). </p><br/><p>Having lost 95 pounds in the last few years, I\'ve learned that there isn\'t a \"best\" way for someone to lose weight. The truth is we are all unique, and what works best for me will almost certainly not be what\'s best for you. That being said, having experienced the benefits of weight loss and a more healthy lifestyle, it\'s my mission to provide anyone looking for guidance with actionable advice that will point them in the right direction. </p><br/><p>In reflecting on how I can do that, I\'ve realized that it will be more helpful for me to share what I have realized is assuredly lousy advice that you should steer clear of. Here are the current trends in dieting that will set you up for failure. </p><br/><h2>Faster Is Better</h2><br/><p>Perhaps the biggest clickbait claim from those pedaling diet advice is that whatever they are selling will give you the results you want fast. Thirty days to shredded with a six-pack may sound great, but it\'s a dangerous way to look at weight loss and sets you up for disappointment. The truth is that we didn\'t gain the weight we are hoping to lose in a few weeks, so we won\'t lose it that quickly, either. Real results take time, and more importantly, to keep those results will require you to develop sustainable habits that continue beyond your dieting days. Rushing the process often means drastic action that is unsustainable and will lead you to break before you get where you want to be. </p><br/><h2>\"X\" Is The Enemy</h2><br/><p>Most every diet pitched online today operates off of the idea that a particular food is what is making you overweight. Demonizing carbs, fat, and even protein is an excellent way to defer blame away from ourselves and move forward with the hope that our problems will be solved if we can avoid a particular food. This strategy may work in the short term, cutting out an entire food group like carbohydrates is likely to have you eating fewer calories than you otherwise would. But, is it sustainable? Unless you plan to avoid those food groups permanently, you will likely gain the weight you did lose back as soon as you introduce those foods back into your diet. </p><br/><h2>More Gym Time = Better</h2><br/><p>If you ask any bodybuilder how they maintain washboard abs and a chiseled physique, current diet trends might have you believe that they would tell you it comes down to a brutal workout routine. While it is true that hitting the gym can help you burn additional calories, sweating like the school mascot on a hot summer day is not what is going to have you looking like a Greek statue. Abs are made in the kitchen, and accordingly, the calories you consume there will be what dictates the majority of your results. You can\'t out-train a bad diet, but you can lose fat without working out. </p><br/><br/><p>Losing weight is one of the most challenging tests of discipline and patience I have experienced. The massive amount of wrong information out there makes this process harder; its difficult to know what to trust. The reality is that there are many strategies you can take to lose weight, none inherently better or worse than any other, so long as you aim to achieve a calorie deficit. The overarching goal with any diet should be to find a food system that allows you to eat enough food to feel full and still enjoy your favorites, all while maintaining the caloric deficit needed to lose weight. It may sound impossible, but by paying attention to what you are putting in your body more closely and adjusting your choices (even just a little!) to reflect your goals you will quickly learn how painless the process can be. </p><br/><p>The biggest myth in dieting is that it has to be miserable in order to work. The reality is, if the strategy you choose makes you miserable, there’s no chance it will work. By being creative and identifying what specific food choices are important to you, you put yourself in a great position to find a strategy that will take you the distance. If you stay consistent and keep faith that it will get easier as you get better at it, I have no doubt you will succeed. </p><br/><p>Best of luck and stick with it! </p>', 'image_id' => 8],

The non-negotiable science of fat loss is that you need to consume fewer calories than your body is using, which results in the use of body fat as fuel to make up the energy difference.

A pound of body fat is about 3000 calories. If you follow your diet Monday-Friday (500 calories x 5 days), you will have accumulated 2500 calories worth of deficit by Friday. A weekend trip to the bar and taco shop can easily wipe this 2500 calorie deficit out in a single bender. Realizing this should be a powerful insight. If you want to get results, you are going to have to commit, even on the weekends. You\'re body also doesn\'t judge you for what type of food you feed it; carbs are no different than protein or fat for fat loss. Eat foods that you can choose consistently, again and again.

The biggest goal when you are trying to lose weight is to find a sustainable system of food choices that allows you to continue eating the foods you already like eating, but adjusting the portions of those foods to allow you to consistently hit your calorie deficit goals. In order to feel full and avoid excessive hunger, low calorie options like vegetables should in incorporated as needed. If you can still eat the foods you like eating (in moderation) and don’t feel hungry all the time, dieting won’t feel like the restrictive punishment it is often made out to be. Rest assured that if you can identify the number of calories you should be eating to achieve a manageable caloric deficit, and find a system of eating that allows you to hit this calorie number more often than not, nothing can stop you! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 9],

These are the steps to take yourself from a recreational runner to the pinnacle of endurance. </p><h2 id=\"i6qrp\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Build Up Slowly </h2><p id=\"iiqn7\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Slow and steady wins the race with this style of training. The truth is that running long distances requires you to practice running... a lot. Building up your volume slowly will be critical to your success. It is prevalent for runners to get injured as they try and increase their running volume. Start training for an ultra only after completing a marathon first, and give yourself at least 12-16 weeks of dedicated training before your event. </p><h2 id=\"i65z3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Tally Up Time On Feet</h2><p id=\"ixztj\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">One of the most interesting shifts away from a typical training program is that for ultra marathons, one of the most important adaptations to build is your tolerance to time on feet. Races will have you running for many hours at a time, and the first thing to fall apart is typically your feet. Forget trying to run fast and start focusing on how to run long. Find a steady pace that keeps your heart rate under control and practice being out there for increasingly long periods. If you can\'t be moving for 4-5 hours straight, this is an excellent baseline to work towards first. </p><h2 id=\"i1szl\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Mental Toughness</h2><p id=\"i0eze\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Ultra Marathons are unquestionably very demanding on your body physically. What makes them unique, and I think more difficult than a regular marathon, is the total time you will be forced to deal with discomfort. You will need to practice getting uncomfortable in training so that you can build confidence in your ability to persevere. </p><h2 id=\"isv7k\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Learn How To Eat</h2><p id=\"i1tqg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Another unique challenge with ultramarathons is the necessity to eat as you are running. Eventually, even the most well-fueled body will need additional calories, or it starts to break down. This is affectionately known as \"bonking\" and is one of the most miserable experiences you can have as a runner. Practice eating 2-300 calories an hour and taking in plenty of fluids; a botched nutrition plan can end the race of even the most physically prepared runner.</p><p id=\"i8axp\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">There you have it! The considerations listed above, if accounted for in your training, will leave you with an excellent chance to finish your first race and call yourself an ultrarunner.

The guesswork is gone for many of life\'s most common struggles, but unfortunately, with weight loss, this mass of information has only made things more confusing. The issue begins with the overwhelming number of strategies available, some of which are only really a realistic option for a select few people. Additionally, the internet has given rise to an unparalleled number of businesses looking to capitalize on providing products that promise to resolve our issues with the scale, even if they don\'t work. </p><br/><p>Many people, already frustrated with their weight and looking to make a positive change for their health and happiness, give up because they don\'t know where to start.

I have no intention of telling you what to do; the truth is there are many ways to skin the weight loss cat, and only one will work best for you individually. My goal, instead, is to give you the basics and allow you to decide which strategy is the most logical for you. </p><br/><p>First things first, you need to understand that calories are KING when it comes to losing weight. (1) This is well established and accepted as fact among scientists and nutritionists and should be the first thing you can have total confidence in. While this may seem restrictive and scary, the truth is that your ability to track your progress will take the frustrating guesswork out of your experience. </p><br/><p>The following diet strategies, currently the most widely used, are all effective BECAUSE they cause a calorie deficit. </p><br/><h2>Keto</h2><br/><p>Known as the low or no-carb diet, Keto works by removing the carbohydrate food group out of your daily food choices. Keto is not effective because carbs make you fat, but rather because it is easier for most to limit their daily calories when they don\'t include tempting and easy to overeat carbs into their food choices. The biggest thing to keep in mind with Keto is that eventually, it is likely you will want to incorporate some carbs back into your diet. The reality is that eliminating essentially all carbohydrates from your meals is difficult to sustain in the long term while also being social and flexible with your choices. If, when you reintroduce carbs, you have not altered your strategy to regulate them in the context of your daily calories, you will likely put on the weight you had lost. </p><br/><h2>Intermittent Fasting (IMF) </h2><br/><p>I like to call IMF the no breakfast diet, as, in principle, it works by limiting the time of day in which you are consuming your food. Most commonly, people will restrict their food intake to an 8-hour window, starting with their first meal during lunchtime. The general idea here is that limiting overall caloric intake for the day is more attainable when your opportunities to do so are reduced. For some people that don’t necessarily have time in the day to cook all of their meals, this option may be an excellent choice. The primary thing to keep in mind with IMF is that it is easier to overeat if you find yourself extremely hungry at the end of the day because you let your appetite catch up to you. </p><br/><h2>Vegetarian / Vegan </h2><br/><p>The vegetarian diet is more of a lifestyle than a diet. It involves committing to only food choices that are not meat specifically and, instead, focusing on consuming a variety of different fruits, vegetables, and greens. Vegans take this an additional step and avoid any products which come from an animal, such as dairy. The main difficulty here is ensuring that you are taking in enough protein to maintain your health. </p><br/><p>The above list is only a very small sampling of the many options commonly used for losing weight. The truth is that you will always come across new strategies pitched as the \"best way\" to lose that pesky belly fat. The optimal strategy for you is likely different from what works for someone else. Remember, though, that the key to any successful diet is finding a way to limit your calories to a number that will cause you to burn body fat. My best advice is to decide which foods you like eating the most and finding a way to eat them in quantities that keep your calories in check. (this may mean smaller portions or ingredient substitutions.)</p><br/><p>Best of luck and remember, STICK WITH IT! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 11],

It is well known that running is one of the best forms of exercise you can find; it all-at-once builds both the cardiovascular system (i.e. the heart) as well as leg and core strength. Why is it that so many people find developing a running routine to be so challenging? </p><br/><p>I struggled with my ability to go out and enjoy a run for as long as I can remember. Running was the method of choice for getting into shape for soccer when I was younger. For some reason, though, when you removed the soccer ball, the task required a herculean effort that left me out of breath and frustrated. Fast forward more than a decade later, and I have finally cracked the puzzle, having incorporated it as an almost daily segment of my fitness routine. </p><br/><p>How did I do it? Here are the most important things I learned that helped me to get off the couch, strap on my running shoes, and even find enjoyment for the process. </p><br/><h2>First Walk, Then Run</h2><br/><p>For many of us, running right out of the gates may not be realistic. The truth is that running is difficult and requires a base level of fitness than many people won\'t have when they first start. The easiest way around this is to slowly build up to jogging by first segmenting the run into a number of walk -> jog intervals. Start out with 30 seconds of jogging, followed by a minute of walking. Continue with this pattern until you accumulate 5-10 minutes of jogging. From there, slowly work up to longer jogging intervals with less rest! </p><br/><h2>Invest In Good Shoes</h2><br/><p>It is worth spending the time and money to go to a proper running shoe store and have yourself fitted for a pair of quality running shoes. We all have different feet, so having an expert that can analyze your specific needs and recommend the proper footwear is imperative to not only your comfort but also for injury prevention. </p><br/><h2>Make It A Group Effort</h2><br/><p>The best way to pass the time running is to run with a group. Find someone of similar fitness and running experience level to you and work on building your stamina together! I cannot stress enough how much more enjoyable this makes running, so break out of your comfort zone and try it! If you are short on running buddies, there are a lot of places locally that you can link up with others. Apps like Meetup have tons of running groups in most places around the US, and typically cover all varieties of schedules as well. Another great place to check in with and get to know is your local running store. While it may be easier to order online or go to one of the larger chains, getting to know your local running store and the community around it can be a game changer. You will likely meet a friendly, inclusive, and motivating bunch who can help keep you on track and progressing towards your goals. They often hold weekly or biweekly running groups and will have a variety of different pace groups running. Get out there and be social, this is one of the best aspects of running!  </p><br/><h2>Set Realistic Goals </h2><br/><p>Nothing is more motivating than knowing you are working towards something meaningful. Find a local 5k race a few months out and commit to showing up at the starting line as fit as possible! The time it takes you to complete the race doesn\'t matter; what matters is that you have a motivation to stick to your training even when you don\'t feel like it. Commit to getting outside your comfort zone; you might surprise yourself! </p><br/><p>Running is truly one of the best forms of exercise you can commit yourself to. It is inexpensive, easy to learn, and the sky is the limit as to how far you can take your fitness. Like anything worth doing, the hardest part is putting yourself out there and getting started! It’s easy to feel frustrated at first, but if you stick to it I promise it will get significantly easier over time. Don\'t worry about how fast or far you are going, get out there and enjoy knowing that you are doing your health and wellbeing a huge favor! Who knows, you may end up liking it too! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 12],

One of the perks of running is that very little gear is needed to get started, but be aware that the shoes you will be looking at have a pretty substantial price range. If you are newer to running, there is no need to be spending as much money as you may want to at first. Avoid the top-shelf racing options and stick to a budget of around $100 or less. For this price, you can get a great pair of shoes without totally breaking the bank. </p><br/><h2>Stability Or Nah? </h2><br/><p>One piece of advice I give all new runners is to seek out a running shoe store than offers for a trained professional to take a look at your stride and arches. New runners often have instable ankles, and arches can vary differently from person to person. Having a professional look at what makes your foot unique will ensure that you are buying shoes that are designed with you in mind. Stability shoes are a significant decision when purchasing running shoes, and it\'s one you don\'t want to get wrong! Ask for help! </p><br/><h2>Heel Drop </h2><br/><p>Just like stability features, running shoes vary widely in how pronounced their heel drop is. This may seem insignificant, but the difference between a high heel and a low or zero drop shoe is enormous. Zero drop shoes mean that your heel is in line with your toes. This will allow for a more natural running form, but can also be hard on your calves and Achilles as they are forced to do a bit extra work. On the flip side, a large 10mm or higher heel lift takes the pressure off of the calf and achilles but can lead to problems down the road if relied on for too long. I recommend finding a heel drop somewhere in the middle, look for a shoe between 6-10mm. </p><br/><h2>Cushion Preference</h2><br/><p>One of the biggest debates in the running world is if a more maximalist or minimalist style of shoe is the best option. Would you prefer to run higher off the ground on a bed of soft, absorbing foam? Or do you like to feel and connect with the ground below you, which offers a more natural feeling while you are cruising around town? One thing that you’ll want to also consider is how long you expect your runs to be. Maximalist sole shoes really shine and provide the optimal benefit to runners who enjoy the longer, slower efforts associated with easy day or long runs. On the flip side, more minimalist soled shoes will benefit those who prefer to go shorter and faster for most of their runs. Try on both styles at the store, and take them both for a jog. There\'s no right answer here; it all comes down to personal preference. </p><br/><p>Follow these tips, and you will set yourself up for success when it comes to finding the right shoes. Most stores offer a return policy of some sort that allows you to try them while still maintaining the ability to return them if they don\'t work. Running shops do this because they know that to find the perfect shoes, it often takes a bit of experimenting. The best thing you can do is get out there and give them all a try. Trust the process, and have confidence that when you find the perfect shoe, you will know it! </p>', 'image_id' => 13],

Here\'s four easy steps to hydration!', 'excerpt' => 'So, how can we rebuild our hydration habits and set ourselves up for success over the long term?', 'body' => '<p>If you weren\'t asleep through the entirety of your grade school science classes, you undoubtedly know that your body is essentially a big water balloon. Science shows that we are comprised of 60% water, meaning that we are more parts water than anything else in our body. Still, most people move throughout their day with no priority towards keeping themselves hydrated to a healthy level. Instead, most of us will choose sugary soda or caffeinated beverages like coffee when we feel thirsty, and that\'s just the beginning of the problems. Chronic dehydration can lead to us learning to interpret our bodies\' cries for water as hunger signals, causing us to overeat, too. As you can probably guess, the adverse health effects of being consistently dehydrated can become significantly detrimental. (1) </p><br/><p>So, how can we commit to a healthier lifestyle and make sure that we get the amount of water that we need? It starts by knowing how much you should be drinking. The old rule of thumb goes something like eight glasses of 8 oz of water per day. Science has shown, however, that this is likely not enough. While your body does do an excellent job of signaling your brain when it needs to be topped off, many of us have unlearned how to interpret these signals properly. As a rule of thumb, science now shows that between .5 and 1 oz of water per pound of your body weight is an optimal target to shoot for. So, how can we rebuild our hydration habits and set ourselves up for success over the long term? </p><br/><p>Here are a few excellent places to start. </p><br/><h2>Have Quality Water On Hand</h2><br/><p>In many parts of the country, the tap water we drink doesn\'t taste good, plain, and simple. In San Diego, where I live, the tap water tastes like chemicals and leaves a gross after taste. The good news is that high-quality, filtered water is cheap! I fill up my 5-gallon jug down the street from my house for only a couple of dollars. Most neighborhoods, especially in areas where the public water isn’t great, will have small business water stores that specialize in treating the public water and making it more palatable. I see this is as a win-win for everyone involved. You have the ability to drink clean tap water without sourcing it from already potentially strained alternative supplies, and you help a small local business in the process! </p><br/><h2>Invest In A Portable Solution </h2><br/><p>Having a high-quality water source at home is excellent, but unless you work from home, the chances are you will need a way to take your water with you. Being on the go often leads to choices other than water to quench our thirst, so set yourself up for success and invest in a large, durable water bottle to keep you on track. Beyond the convenience of having water with you while you are on the go, another benefit to carrying a water bottle is it’s a great place to display stickers! I notice people almost daily that use their water bottles as a place to show off the things they care about, and think it’s a really great idea. Stay hydrated and express yourself; talk about two birds with one stone! </p><br/><h2>Start Your Day Off Right </h2><br/><p>First thing in the morning, commit to drinking a large glass of cool water. It will not only help you wake up and start your day off right, but it puts you ahead of the curve as far as your daily consumption. I’ve worked getting a large glass of water into my morning routine, and have noticed a significant difference when I reflect on how I feel the rest of the day after drinking a glass of water in the morning. </p><br/><h2>Avoid Late Night Catch Up </h2><br/><p>If you find yourself behind on water intake for the day at the end of the night, it\'s important you don\'t go overboard trying to catch up. A glass of water is a good strategy, but several glasses to make up from earlier in the day are not. Nothing will train you to dislike hydrating more than having to pee several times throughout the night. </p><br/><p>Drinking water is not only crucial for your health and critical to you feeling your best throughout the day, but it can be part of a larger routine to put yourself first. Water is cheap and plentiful; it just requires a solid strategy and good habit building to ensure you are getting enough! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 14],

Here are the three best calorie counting tips I learned while losing 95 pounds!', 'excerpt' => 'You likely can eat more calories than you believe (check out a TDEE Calculator to find out), and these simple tricks will get you on the right path.', 'body' => '<p>There is a lot of conflicting information about how to lose weight circulating online; for most, the process of sorting through what to trust and what to ignore can be frustrating enough that they don\'t ever really get started. Committing to any long term challenge, especially one that requires a heavy dose of discipline, is more-or-less impossible if you don\'t have full confidence that the process you are following is going to lead to the results you are looking for. </p><br/><br/><p>Luckily, science has agreed (for a while now!) that calories are all that matter when it comes to losing fat. You can think of calories like gasoline for your body\'s engine. As you move throughout your day, your body burns calories to generate the energy it needs to keep up. The calories that you burn come from food. If you are consuming fewer calories than your body is burning, you will need to make that energy difference up somewhere. It turns out that body fat is the primary energy reserve the body will tap! </p><br/><br/><p>So, eating fewer calories than you are burning, consistently, will get you the results you have been chasing! </p><br/><br/><p>I think that many people hear this and would rather not believe it. After all, this is far from a quick fix! There is no secret ingredient you can add or subtract from your diet (cough... carbs) that will have you magically losing fat. Portion control will be the key that unlocks fat loss. Don\'t fret, though! You likely can eat more calories than you believe (check out a TDEE Calculator to find out), and these simple tricks will get you on the right path. </p><br/><br/><h2>Avoid Liquid Calories</h2><br/><p>Avoiding beverages that have high-calorie totals can be a game-changer for your diet success. Drinks like soda and beer are packed with upwards of 2-300 calories in a 16 oz serving. What\'s worse, these drinks will do nothing to satiate your hunger, and most will slightly dehydrate you, leaving you craving the next glass. Liquid calories can quickly get out of control and steamroll a day or even week\'s progress. Diet sodas with no calories are a perfect alternative! </p><br/><br/><h2>Load Up On Veggies First</h2><br/><p>Vegetables are an essential part of any healthy diet, whether you are trying to lose weight or not. They are packed with the nutrients that your body needs to function optimally, and the fiber they contain is necessary for maintaining proper digestion. For weight loss, they are an excellent tool, as they contain very few calories. Did you know that an entire cucumber is only 45 calories?</p><br/><br/><h2>Cook At Home</h2><br/><p>Restaurants are a fun and exciting way to try a wide variety of foods, not to mention they can be extremely convienent. They pose a significant problem when trying to lose weight; however, as the food served in restaurants is typically loaded with additional calories to ensure it tastes great and keeps you coming back. Having control over your meals and precisely what goes in them is imperative to the success of your diet. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>The tips above are not a solve-all for losing weight, but implementing them into your food choices while you are trying to lose weight will give you an excellent baseline to start. Losing weight is all about consistency, so stick with it and don\'t give up! You will get better at it with practice! </p><br/><br/>', 'image_id' => 15],

Here\'s the four biggest things I learned while using meal prep to lose 95 pounds!', 'excerpt' => 'Follow these meal prep hacks, and you, too, can make all of your healthy eating goals a reality.', 'body' => '<p>For many, the quality of their food choices comes down to the time they have. For many of us, food is a second or third priority to the other activities that keep us busy throughout the day. It\'s during these times that most of us make the food choices we end up regretting, and, when it happens too often, it is reflective on our waistline. The reality is that the food choices we make out of convenience, be it on-the-go from restaurants, fast food or gas stations, are often the ones that set us back the furthest from being the healthiest version of ourselves. </p><br/><p>In my journey of losing 95 pounds, this was without question, the most critical thing I had to learn and find a solution for. Like you are currently, I turned to the internet for advice and found a massive number of potential solutions. Some of these were more helpful than others, but the most game-changing strategy I picked up on was meal prep. By blocking my time more effectively, I was able to cook just a few hours each week and have healthy, on the go meals that kept me on track towards my fitness goals. Here are the most life-changing strategies I learned while meal prepping. Follow these meal prep hacks, and you, too, can make all of your healthy eating goals a reality. </p><br/><h2>Fire Up The Grill</h2><br/><p>It shouldn\'t be a secret that protein is vital to any healthy eating plan. Low in calories and very filling, proteins are an excellent way to keep calories low without feeling like you are starving yourself. Fire up the grill, and don\'t hold back. You can grill a variety of lean proteins like chicken and beef that will last you the week while only taking a short while to cook. Switching it up from week to week keeps your meals from getting boring and ensures you will stay on track. </p><br/><h2>Dice Your Veggies </h2><br/><p>Just like proteins, vegetables are a mandatory part of any healthy eating diet. Unfortunately, when we grab a quick bite on the go, these vitamin-packed superfoods are usually the first to disappear. Grab a rainbow of colors and dice away! It doesn\'t take as long as you might think once you are in the zone, and having them pre-cut can make all the difference. If you are especially short on time and/or maybe you just don’t particularly like cutting onions, check out your local grocery store! The produce department of most larger grocery stores will have precut veggies that are already diced and ready to go. They can be a little more expensive, but the cost difference is largely made up, for me at least, when I consider how many veggies I throw away because I was too lazy or busy to prepare them myself. Another thing to consider is that predicted veggies will be ripe and great to eat the moment you buy them, but will also expire slightly faster as well. </p><br/><h2>Assemble In Advance</h2><br/><p>Sometimes life has a way of preventing us from our commitments no matter how dedicated we might be to them. You can\'t necessarily control what life will throw at you, but by using the time you do have wisely and assembling your meals in Tupperware, you can grab and go even when time is limited. You can order Tupperware in bulk online fairly cheaply, and by having a plentiful supply around the house you stand a much higher chance of using it for your meal prep! </p><br/><h2>Keep It Fun </h2><br/><p>Bringing your loved ones or friends into the meal prep party can turn a healthy habit into a legitimately fun time. Involve the people in your life with your meal prep, and you can save time and encourage the people you care about to make the same healthy choices you are. Alternatively, you can split the work and trade-off weeks. Find a system that works for you and keeps you accountable; there\'s no need for excuses! </p><br/><p>Meal prepping can take the craziness of our lives and add a little structure to our food choices. The truth is most of us have the right intentions when we step outside our door to start the day, but, in the hustle and bustle, it\'s easy to lose sight of what\'s important and grab what\'s convenient. By meal prepping, you are setting yourself up for success and ensuring that your health goals remain in sight even when it feels like you don\'t have time. </p><br/><p>Happy Prepping! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 16],

Here are the biggest things I wish I would have known to reduce my anxiety starting Crossfit', 'excerpt' => 'It can be intimidating to start, but by following this advice, you set yourself up for success and ensure that you will be fitter five years from now than you are today, regardless of your age.', 'body' => '<p>CrossFit has boomed in popularity over recent years, with boxes (CrossFit lingo for a gym) popping up in seemingly every neighborhood. There\'s a good reason for this, CrossFit delivers on their promise to get results fast, following their methodology can transform your fitness and have you accomplishing athletic feats you would never have imagined you\'d be capable of. </p><br/><p>I say this with such confidence because I\'ve experienced it firsthand. CrossFit was instrumental in me losing 95 pounds and going from a guy that could barely jog a 400m lap around the track to someone doing muscle-ups and handstand pushups. There\'s nothing special about my case; in fact, it\'s quite the opposite. I have witnessed countless others walk through the doors of the same box I attend and totally 180 their fitness just as I did. </p><br/><p>The only sticking point is that CrossFit can be intimidating. Popular opinion says that it can be dangerous and lead to injury, and the truth is that the learning curve is pretty steep. Even still, the rumors are largely unfounded, and by following these steps, you can smoothly transition into this life-changing fitness routine and never look back. Here\'s what you have to know:</p><br/><h2>Find The Right Gym</h2><br/><p>Finding the right gym community is going to be imperative to your comfort and safety. Not all boxes are created equal, and that goes for the coaching and the community you\'ll be immersed in. Seek out a box that has coaches willing to help you and a community you feel welcomed and supported by. It’s a common slogan at many boxes that their goal for you as a member is for the class you attend to be the best hour of your day… every time. I can say from experience that a great gym will live up to that lengthy goal, so don’t be afraid to be picky and expect a lot for your membership dues. I promise, there are many excellent gyms out there if you are willing to look. </p><br/><h2>Identify Your Strengths And Weaknesses</h2><br/><p>One of the most important things you can do when you start CrossFit is getting the attention of a trained coach to walk you through a movement screen. During this time they will work with you one on one to show you the different movements you\'ll be doing in class and, more importantly, they will identify any problem areas you will need to pay extra attention to. Naturally there will be movements that you gravitate towards, and it’s fun to excel in those areas. On the flip side, there will be areas of your fitness that are more challenging, but stick with it and you’ll quickly close those gaps. </p><br/><h2>Embrace Scaling And Start Slow </h2><br/><p>Many people believe that CrossFit is dangerous because it has you performing movements that you are not ready for or capable of doing. While it is true that CrossFit does have a number of high skill movements that will take practice to master, the beauty of CrossFit is that there is always a scaling option. Don\'t feel comfortable doing handstand pushups? You\'re not at all alone, and, luckily, there are a number of less challenging movements that will give you the same workout stimulus. The CrossFit Methodology really shines in this sense, and it’s why the training style can be applied appropriately to everyone from children to senior citizens! The beauty is that CrossFit, with its use of scaling, is able to meet you where you are at as far as your fitness level. There’s no barrier to entry here, even if it might look a little intimidating. </p><br/><h2>Keep Score And Celebrate Improvement</h2><br/><p>It may seem counterintuitive, but keeping track of how you are doing on your workouts, I believe, is important for every athlete, especially beginners. As I mentioned before, the learning curve in CrossFit can be steep, so progress can feel like it is coming very slowly. By keeping track of how you do right from the start, you allow yourself to be amazed as you look back even a month later and compare your progress! </p><br/><p>CrossFit is a game-changing fitness routine for anyone willing to take a leap of faith and give it a shot. It can be intimidating to start, but, by following this advice, you set yourself up for success and ensure that you will be fitter five years from now than you are today, regardless of your age. Leave your ego at the door and enjoy the journey; CrossFit is a sport that will continue to reward your hard work with unmatched results and a truly genuine sense of accomplishment.

Every year mountains of additional content promising it is, \"the last article you will ever need to read about weight loss,\" but in the end, almost all of them try and sell you something. </p><br/><p>THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE ARTICLES!!!</p><br/><p>The truth is that I have no motive to do anything other than tell you what has stood out to me as the most intriguing trends in weight loss over the last few years. During that time, I dove in and managed to find the bottom of the weight loss rabbit hole, sorting through all degrees of nonsense on my journey of losing 95 pounds. </p><br/><p>Rest assured that just because diets such as keto and intermittent fasting don\'t appear on this list, it doesn\'t mean I haven\'t thoroughly researched or even support them. The truth is that through all my research, I have found that there are a considerable number of strategies that can be effective for losing weight. The main issue I have seen, though, is that the plan that you choose has to be sustainable indefinitely. If you revert to old habits, you will inevitably regain the weight you lost. To keep the weight off and enjoy the results of your hard work over the long haul, you will need to find sustainable eating habits that you both enjoy and will keep you full in the portions required to maintain your new lower weight. </p><br/><p>The following are a few of the newest strategies I have found that might be the golden ticket you are looking for to accomplish your weight loss goals. </p><br/><h2>800 Gram Challenge</h2><br/><p>This diet caught my attention because of how it approaches food choices. The premise of the challenge is that you eat 800 grams of fruits and vegetables every day. So long as you do that, you are free to eat whatever else you like (obviously within some moderation). This diet works by inclusion instead of exclusion and gives you more freedom to hang on to the foods you love while still finding results (cough. carbs). </p><br/><p>Fruits and vegetables are very low in calories but have a lot of volume and will help you to feel full on less overall calories. This approach ensures that you are getting all of the nutrients you need for your overall health. Getting in the routine of eating more fruits and vegetables is an excellent long term approach to keeping your results! </p><br/><h2>Add A Habit Challenge</h2><br/><p>The add a habit challenge asks you to add one new healthy habit every week, eventually building up to an overall healthy lifestyle. One progression I\'ve seen people start with is first to cut out liquid calories from soda first (switch to diet!), then add in vegetables at two meals per day. From there, you can build in whatever direction calls to you; start addressing the most significant holes in your diet, and you are well on your way to a healthier, happier you! This approach works really well for a lot of people because instead of focusing on restriction and what you “can’t” do, the add a habit challenge encourages you to slowly add in beneficial habits instead. The overall approach feels a lot more encouraging, and allows you to build yourself up instead of break yourself down. </p><br/><h2>Cook Your Meals Challenge</h2><br/><p>It\'s not a secret that restaurants pack their meals with extra calories to ensure that their food tastes amazing. Unfortunately, this is not conducive to losing weight. Making an effort to cook all of your meals, and more importantly, see what is going into them keeps you in the driver\'s seat towards your goals. If you are short on recipes or ideas, the internet is an excellent place to start. A very basic google search will turn up all sorts of results for healthy versions of your most high calorie favorites. Also, learning to cook is fun! It can be a relaxing way to slow down your day and take a minute for yourself. Commit yourself to buy healthy food choices at the store and skip the restaurants for a while, you will see and feel the results immediately! </p><br/><br/><p>The best advice for losing weight is that you have to find a strategy that works for you. Truthfully we are all different; we have unique preferences and lifestyles that make what is best for you different than what is best for others. Experimenting to find what works (and is sustainable!) for you will be critical to your success. Give the challenges above a shot. Who knows, they might be what you needed to accomplish your goals!</p>', 'image_id' => 18],

Here are four things to keep in mind while looking for a new gym!', 'excerpt' => 'In reflecting on those choices I have come up with four considerations I believe are critical to ensuring you have found the perfect new gym home.', 'body' => '<p>Finding a new gym can be stressful and intimidating. Whether you have recently moved and need a new gym to call home or just have been out of the game and are looking to prioritize your fitness, finding the right gym takes a bit more consideration than many people give it. Spending time to investigate your options or going with whatever you stumble across first can be the difference between your commitment to fitness, taking a positive step in the right direction, and setting yourself up for inevitable failure. </p><br/><p>In the last few years on my fitness quest, I have come across the need to find a new gym a few different times. With the benefit of hindsight, I can say that some of my choices were good while others left a lot to be desired. In reflecting on those choices I have come up with four considerations I believe are critical to ensuring you have found the perfect new gym home. </p><br/><h2>Proximity</h2><br/><p>This should be pretty obvious, but I think it\'s still important to mention. You could find a gym that is perfect for you in every way, but if it\'s too far from your home or office, the likelihood you will choose to go when you don\'t feel like it diminishes as the distance traveled to get there increases. That is not to say that selecting the closest gym to you is always the best choice, but you should be honest with yourself before committing and decide if the distance makes that choice realistic for you or not. With fitness, consistency is everything; you need to be able to make it in the door often for what you do there to be effective. </p><br/><h2>Hours</h2><br/><p>Just like proximity, the hours the gym is open have to fit with your schedule. Do you like to work out early in the morning before work? If so, you\'ll need to make sure the gym is open early enough that you can get in and out with plenty of time to get ready for work. The same goes for evening hours. Many gyms have 24-hour access available, which is an excellent feature that is worth prioritizing as you come to a decision. </p><br/><h2>Classes / Equipment</h2><br/><p>So you found a gym that is close by and works with your schedule. The next step is making sure that the gym you choose has the equipment you like to use! There are many ways to get a great workout in, and gyms have a huge variety of different equipment. What you like using, whether it be cardio machines or barbells, is unique to you. It would be best if you found a gym that caters to the style of workouts you enjoy most. Likewise, group classes are an excellent feature that some gyms offer. Most will have their class schedules posted on their website, take a peek and find a gym with classes to keep you showing up on days you don\'t have the energy to do it by yourself. </p><br/><h2>Cleanliness / Vibe</h2><br/><p>Do you prefer a powerlifting gym, complete with chalk on the floors and the smell of hard work wafting through the air, humid with sweat? Or maybe you would prefer a health club where clean locker rooms and more \"after work\" atmosphere is prevalent? There is no right answer here other than its important you choose a gym where you feel comfortable. Do you feel comfortable going through your routine in the new gym? If not, you\'ll want to keep looking for somewhere that feels like home. One important thing to realize, though, is that no gym will feel totally comfortable right off the bat, even to the most seasoned gym veteran. Instead of focusing on how you feel the first day, take a look around the gym and identify people you seemingly could relate to. Do they look comfortable there? If they are smiling and moving through their routine confidently, chances are good that with a little familiarity you can do the same!  </p><br/><p>Finding a new gym can be a daunting task, especially if you are more new to fitness. Keeping in mind the suggestions outlined above will go a long way towards you finding a new gym you feel comfortable. No gym will be perfect, and you\'ll have to weigh your priorities to some extent, but some options are better for YOU than others. </p><br/><p>Best of luck, and see you at the squat rack! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 19],

The opportunity only comes around every so often, but with the price tag involved making sure you have the best strategy to secure a great deal should be a priority. If you ask around, you will likely get a variety of advice on what the best tactics are, with some of that advice undoubtedly being better than the rest. If you are like me, you\'ve often wondered if you are getting the best deal, or if you are leaving cash on the table by forgetting some critical piece of the car buying puzzle that could have landed you a better deal. </p><br/><br/><p>In the process of buying a number of both new and used cars from dealerships, I can honestly say that I\'ve experienced both sides of the car buying experience. After some hard lessons learned, here are the essential tips I have learned to be critical in you securing the best deal on your new dream car. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Get Your Financing First</h2><br/><p>Shopping around for the best rate on a car loan, whether it be new or used, can save you time and headaches down the road. By having the money side of things figured out before you start shopping, you can go into the process with a realistic budget you feel comfortable with and won\'t have the heartbreaking realization that you can\'t afford the car you want later on. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Do Your Research </h2><br/><p>With any major investment, it\'s important to do your research ahead of time. Before you go to the dealership and subject yourself to a potentially slippery sales associate, know what cars are the best for you and a ballpark of how much they should cost with the options you want. Shopping at the dealership without this info can have you thinking with your eyes and emotions, not your wallet and logic. </p><br/><br/><h2>Show Up At The Right Time</h2><br/><p>It\'s no secret that there are times throughout the month and year that are better for buying a car than others. The most common misconception is that by showing up before the dealership closes, you are likely to get the best deal, as the salesperson helping you want to wrap up their day. This is, unfortunately, not how it works. Better advice is to take advantage of the end of the month or end of quarter sales put on by dealerships looking to hit quotas and clear out inventory. Take advantage of these sales and see huge savings when it comes time to pay! </p><br/><br/><h2>Shop Around</h2><br/><p>When you\'ve found the car you want, you must shop around at multiple dealerships to see who is willing to give you the best price. Remember that this is a business transaction and not a favor, so don\'t expect royal treatment. Because you are the one putting money down, make sure you put your options through their paces. One dealership will be willing to go lower than the others; it\'s just a matter of finding it. </p><br/><br/><h2>Negotiate Correctly </h2><br/><p>Being willing to walk away is the most significant rule of negotiation. Remember that you hold all of the power as you are the one paying for the car; don\'t get bullied by a pushy salesperson.

If you commit to holding your course, you will come out the winner every time! Happy Hunting!</p><p>Buying a new or used car from the dealership can be one of the most exciting purchases you will make. The opportunity only comes around every so often, but with the price tag involved making sure you have the best strategy to secure a great deal should be a priority. If you ask around, you will likely get a variety of advice on what the best tactics are, with some of that advice undoubtedly being better than the rest. If you are like me, you\'ve often wondered if you are getting the best deal, or if you are leaving cash on the table by forgetting some critical piece of the car buying puzzle that could have landed you a better deal. </p><br/><p>In the process of buying a number of both new and used cars from dealerships, I can honestly say that I\'ve experienced both sides of the car buying experience. After some hard lessons learned, here are the essential tips I have learned to be critical in you securing the best deal on your new dream car. </p><br/><h2>Get Your Financing First</h2><br/><p>Shopping around for the best rate on a car loan, whether it be new or used, can save you time and headaches down the road. By having the money side of things figured out before you start shopping, you can go into the process with a realistic budget you feel comfortable with and won\'t have the heartbreaking realization that you can\'t afford the car you want later on. </p><br/><h2>Do Your Research </h2><br/><p>With any major investment, it\'s important to do your research ahead of time. Before you go to the dealership and subject yourself to a potentially slippery sales associate, know what cars are the best for you and a ballpark of how much they should cost with the options you want. Shopping at the dealership without this info can have you thinking with your eyes and emotions, not your wallet and logic. </p><br/><h2>Show Up At The Right Time</h2><br/><p>It\'s no secret that there are times throughout the month and year that are better for buying a car than others. The most common misconception is that by showing up before the dealership closes, you are likely to get the best deal, as the salesperson helping you want to wrap up their day. This is, unfortunately, not how it works. Better advice is to take advantage of the end of the month or end of quarter sales put on by dealerships looking to hit quotas and clear out inventory. Take advantage of these sales and see huge savings when it comes time to pay! </p><br/><h2>Shop Around</h2><br/><p>When you\'ve found the car you want, you must shop around at multiple dealerships to see who is willing to give you the best price. Remember that this is a business transaction and not a favor, so don\'t expect royal treatment. Because you are the one putting money down, make sure you put your options through their paces. One dealership will be willing to go lower than the others; it\'s just a matter of finding it. </p><br/><h2>Negotiate Correctly </h2><br/><p>Being willing to walk away is the most significant rule of negotiation. Remember that you hold all of the power as you are the one paying for the car; don\'t get bullied by a pushy salesperson. Set a time limit with them out front and let them know you mean business by having the research you\'ve done with you. If it feels like they are jerking you around, it\'s time to stand up and walk away. Often, they will reach out and call you to meet in the middle before you even get home! </p><br/><p>Buying a car can be a fun and exciting process.

Don\'t get wrapped up in the emotion of it all, though, or you may find yourself on the receiving end of a bad deal. Stick to your guns, do your research, and know that you deserve the best price. You have to take control of the car buying experience or you will let the salesman do that for you. I don’t think I need to explain why this may not be in your best interest. If you commit to holding your course, though, you will come out the winner every time! Happy Hunting! </p>', 'image_id' => 20],

Here are the five most important things to boost your resale value!', 'excerpt' => 'Here are five hot tips that you can follow to make sure you are getting the most out of your car not only while you are driving it, but also when it comes time to sell it and move on.', 'body' => '<p>Your car is one of the most significant investments a majority of people have, and the money you get back when you go to sell it depends largely on how you maintain and take care of your car while you own it. While it is true that some depreciation is unavoidable, maximizing the money you can sell the vehicle for is more in your own hands than you might realize. </p><br/><p>Here are five hot tips that you can follow to make sure you are getting the most out of your car not only while you are driving it, but also when it comes time to sell it and move on. </p><br/><h2>1) Maintenance Matters</h2><br/><p>As you might be able to guess, a broken car that makes strange noises or otherwise doesn\'t operate properly is going to hurt you when it comes time to sell. Keep up with all of the recommended maintenance suggested by the manufacturer, even if it doesn\'t seem necessary at the moment. The cost to fix it may seem high but will only get more expensive the longer you wait, especially when it starts to cause additional problems! </p><br/><h2>2) Be Mindful of Mileage </h2><br/><p>Mileage is one of the most important factors that people consider when going to purchase a car. It is a key indicator of how much wear and tear is on the engine and other components and is one of the most accessible numbers that can throw off the value of your otherwise well-maintained car. When planning long road trips or volunteering your car for the carpool, keep in mind that the mileage you are racking up will cost you later. Some mileage is unavoidable, but limiting it where you can makes a world of difference when it comes time to resell. </p><br/><h2>3) Keep it Clean</h2><br/><p>It\'s fair to say that nobody wants to buy a dirty, disgusting car that smells like an old gym locker. The mess you make today could affect your resale tomorrow, especially if you let it get out of hand. Damage to the interior surfaces and upholstery, not to mention the potential smell, will build on itself and become a long term problem if you let it get out of hand. A minute or two every day makes the difference between a used car dream and a pile of junk! </p><br/><br/><h2>4) Avoid the Permanent Messes</h2><br/><p>Smoke and dog hair are two common problems that can throw off your chances of a successful sale. Used car buyers have many options when they go to buy a car, and so if your vehicle is covered with (nearly) impossible to remove dog hair or smells like smoke, chances are you will take a hit in the resale value. Keep the eventual sale in mind before you choose to invite your furry friend, you\'ll be glad you did! One version of a permanent mess that many people neglect to realize is so important when it comes time to selling their car are hard to remove smells. Often coming from incense, habitual air fresheners, or worst of all, cigarettes, these smells are offensive to pretty much anyone who might be interested in buying your car. The problem with these smells is that, especially if you have cloth seats, the smells can stick to the fabric and become nearly impossible to remove. If you’ve ever sat in a car with someone that has a habit of smoking cigarettes you know exactly how gross this is and can likely envision how costly the smell is when it comes time to resell the car. </p><br/><h2>5) Paperwork or it Didn\'t Happen</h2><br/><p>Upgrades and repairs can be a significant asset when it comes time to resell your car and can be the deciding factor for your buyer. Unfortunately, some other sellers are dishonest and will claim to have done work that never actually happened. This means that if you want to get the maximum value for your car with the upgrades and repairs you\'ve done, it\'s best to be able to prove it! Keep all paperwork and receipts; you will see the payoff when it comes time to sell! </p><br/><br/><p>The process of selling a used car can be time consuming but doesn\'t have to be a headache or be hard on your wallet. Taking these steps while you own your vehicle only takes a little effort but will pay off immensely for you when it comes time to sell. You likely invested a lot of your hard earned money into your car, and hopefully have some good memories with it to. Getting the most out of your car when it comes time to sell will leave you satisfied with your investment and excited to start a new journey with your next car! Best of luck! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 21],
   ['id' => 22, 'status' => 1, 'title' => 'Buying A Used Car? | Blueprint To Finding The Best Deal', 'description' => 'Buying the right used car can save you money, but how do you know which used car to buy? Follow these four tips to find the best deal!', 'excerpt' => 'It only takes one negative used car buying experience to realize that the process of finding and buying a preowned car can quickly become a nightmare for many years to come.', 'body' => '<p>It only takes one negative used car buying experience to realize that the process of finding and buying a preowned car can quickly become a nightmare for many years to come. The truth is that cars are a huge investment, and, more importantly, we rely on them to get us to the most critical places in our lives. Used cars are the smart financial decision for most people, especially when you consider how much new cars depreciate immediately when you drive them off the lot. </p><br/><p>On the flip side, though, buying a used car is only as smart as you are about finding the right one. Overlooking details while you are shopping can quickly result in expensive mechanic fixes or, worse, complete lemons. Unfortunately, many drivers each year make the wrong decision and end up with seemingly endless bills and a massive headache. </p><br/><p>So, how can you avoid the potential pitfalls of buying a used car and make sure you are spending your money and putting your trust into a vehicle that will perform up to expectations? Follow these critical steps, and you will have the kind of used car buying strategy that leaves you in the driver\'s seat towards a good deal and keeps disaster in the rearview. </p><br/><h2>Be Realistic In Your Search</h2><br/><p>Most of the time the biggest rip-offs when it comes to buying a used car originate from people\'s desire to get more than they are paying for. Just like anything in life, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. When you consider your budget, look for cars that are not significantly depreciated to be that price. The lower price is often because of extremely high mileage, mechanical problems, or a bad history of crashes. By sticking to a car that is more towards the middle of its life and has a clean bill of health, you are saving yourself the trouble of walking into a potential trap.</p><br/><h2>Give It A Thorough Once Over</h2><br/><p>When you go to look at a potential option, the most immediately helpful thing you can do for yourself is spending adequate time looking at the interior and exterior of the car. This may seem obvious, but by paying attention to the little details, you can learn a lot about how previous owners treated the car. Unexplainable dents can point towards more significant problems hidden underneath, and a wrecked interior often reflects the overall beating the car took in the past. Checking for leaks can also be an easy way to identify more severe problems. </p><br/><h2>Take It To The Experts</h2><br/><p>Having a trustworthy mechanic look at the car before you commit to buying it can help you avoid a car with problems you don\'t have the training to spot yourself. The fact is that cars are complex machinery and the everyday driver doesn\'t understand everything that may be important. Having a professional check it out only costs a fraction of what the repairs on a bad car might down the road. </p><br/><h2>Do Your Homework</h2><br/><p>When it comes time to purchase the car you\'ve taken through all the steps mentioned previously, you must know the fair market value before you enter negotiations. Spending the time to study the market and find what the same car in a similar condition has sold for recently in your area gives you a great bargaining chip when it comes time to get the deal done. Trust your research, and don\'t get sucked into paying more than the car is worth. It is better to wait for a fair deal than jump the gun and overpay. </p><br/><br/><p>Buying a used car can be frustrating, the reality is that to find the best deal it will likely take more time and energy than you initially wanted to spend. Because of this, you may be tempted to buy the first shiny looking car that seems like it is workable. Resist the urge! The majority of people selling their cars are interested in getting the most money possible when cashing in their investment; logic should indicate that most buying opportunities do not favor the buyer. However, following this strategy leaves you set up for success when it comes time to buying a used car. By purchasing used, you are saving yourself from the significant depreciation that faces all new vehicles when they are driven off the lot. Still, you only save money if you purchase intelligently. The truth is that there are good deals and bad deals out there, so be sure to follow this strategy and find the right deal for you! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 22],

Your car is an expression of yourself, and you don\'t need to have one of the fancy exotic brands or leather seats and a sunroof to make a statement. Maintaining your car and keeping it clean is about so much more than just preserving the resale value, it\'s about creating and sticking to the daily routines that will carry over into other aspects of your life. </p><br/><p>Here are four quick and easy tips that take 30 seconds or less to do, but will make a world of difference in keeping you and your car feeling brand new. </p><br/><h2>1) Avoid The Gym Locker Effect </h2><br/><p>We\'ve all been in cars that smell like an old gym locker, and it can make even the most beautiful vehicle unpleasant to ride in. Unfortunately, if your car is always looking (and smelling!) like a gym locker, you may get used to it and not even know! Clutter from fast food meals, mid-day outfit changes, and the musty gym bag in the trunk not only take up room and look unorganized, but they can smell bad too! The situation gets even worse in the summer when high temperatures can turn your car into an oven! Make a habit of always emptying your car at the end of the day; it takes only a few seconds if you keep up with it and don\'t let things pile up! </p><br/><br/><h2>2) Tell Dust To Hit The Road</h2><br/><p>One of the most common problems that face car owners is the dust that builds up on the dashboard and other flat surfaces. Beyond looking dirty, dust can negatively affect the quality of the air you are breathing and, if left long enough, can clump up and collect in unwanted places. Even though you likely won\'t have any noticeable build-up daily, it\'s a good idea to keep a cloth or car wipes easily accessible for daily wipe downs of your dash and other flat surfaces. </p><br/><br/><h2>3) Cup Holder Etiquette </h2><br/><p>Nothing is more disgusting when driving in a car than reaching for the cup holder only to find sticky, gross coins stuck to the bottom. Although this sounds barbaric, it is the sad fate of many car cup holders. The truth is that these convenient tools often become mini trash bins, home to spare change, old wrappers, and leaky fast food cups. Be conscious of what you set in your cup holder, and wipe it out with an all-purpose cleaner regularly!</p><br/><br/><h2>4) Shake It Out</h2><br/><p>The most susceptible place in your car to collect dirt and grime is your carpets. The carpet condition is important for resale and will be easily noticeable when riding in the car. (after all, we look down to place our feet when we get in!) Diligence goes a long way here; shaking the carpets out takes only a few seconds and will make a world of difference. Rubber floor mats are also an excellent investment as they don\'t cost much and will go a long way to preserving your floors!</p><br/><br/><h2>5) Wipe Down Your Windows</h2><br/><p>Stopping to fill up your tank at the gas pump is an inevitable part of owning and driving a car. In the past, I used to stand around, staring at the bill slowly rack up and wondering why it was so expensive to use a car I had already paid a lot of money for. In the past few years, I decided I might be a little more productive with my time, and started cleaning my windows. Initially turned off from the idea as I drove away with streaks of window cleaner dripping down my windshield, I stayed committed and quickly became a master at cleaning my windows. Now? I treat it like the pitstop of a Nascar race. How fast (and well!) I can clean my windows has become a game that is infinitely more entertaining than watching the numbers slowly creep up. The best part? My car windows are always clean and I’m never left dealing with the window grime unexpectedly. </p><br/><br/><p>The saying goes that \"a clean car is a happy car,\" and I couldn\'t agree more! Try the tips above, and you will realize just how easy it can be to maintain your car in a condition you can be proud of! The fact that all of these steps take 30 seconds or less should be the icing on the cake, especially when you realize how much more enjoyable your car rides will become! </p>', 'image_id' => 23],

Here are the four best ways to keep a road trip fun!', 'excerpt' => 'Following these road trip tips will keep the fun level high and the headaches in the rearview mirror, so read closely!', 'body' => '<p>Road trips are one of the great American traditions. Whether it be for a coming of age test of freedom, the first steps to a life-changing move, or just the vacation of a lifetime, road trips often signal the defining moments of our lives. There is no better way to see the country than to spend a day or two driving through it, experiencing the back roads, small towns, and rest stops that make this country quirky and unique. </p><br/><p>That being said, road trips also have the potential to take an unfortunate wrong term and can quickly become one of the most challenging tests of patience. Having taken many road trips in the past, some that ended with stories I\'ll tell my grandkids and others I have blocked out of memory completely, I\'ve realized that a successful road trip depends on a few things. Here are the most important things to keep in mind when you are planning a road trip. Following these road trip tips will keep the fun level high and the headaches in the rearview mirror, so read closely! </p><br/><h2>Take Your Time</h2><br/><p>There is nothing worse than being stuck in the car cross country while also being in a hurry to get where you are going. Trying to rush a road trip can lead to anything from awkward silence to full-on road rage, so it\'s best to avoid any need to keep the pedal to the floor. By budgeting enough time to get where you are going, you avoid this before it becomes an issue. Remember that the longer the trip, the more likely unexpected stops will slow you down, so be sure to plan accordingly. </p><br/><h2>Take The Scenic Route</h2><br/><p>A big part of budgeting enough time should including prioritizing your route to include interesting break spots. If you have the luxury of enough time, make sure to plan a side trip or two so that you have checkpoints to look forward to along the way that break up the drive into more manageable chunks. If you have to get where you are going on a particular schedule, finding restaurants and quick attractions can similarly keep you from fixating on how far you still have to go. </p><br/><h2>Keep Everyone Entertained</h2><br/><p>If you are traveling with friends or family, you must ensure everyone in the car has the entertainment to keep them busy while they are not driving. To rely on a conversation for more than a few hours can put a strain on the situation, and sometimes the radio just doesn\'t cut it. One bored passenger can end up being a nightmare for the entire car, so be sure that everyone has a reliable (and quiet!) way to pass the time. Low on electronics and want to be more social? There are a variety of games you can play as a car that are wholesome and don’t create the opportunity for arguments. The first is the license plate game, which is played by making a list of the fifty states and attempting to spot and call out a license plate for all of them. Can you spot them all before you get to your destination? The other game that passes the time well is the alphabet game, where players attempt to spot and call out words that are written as you drive by which start with each of the letters of the alphabet. The catch? You must move from one to the next in order!</p><br/><h2>Pick Healthy Snacks</h2><br/><p>Road trip snacks can be almost as important as directions when it comes to traveling long distances in a car. Avoiding regular stops for food can save money and allow you to be more efficient with your time. Choosing foods that are greasy, sugary, or otherwise, leave you feeling gross, however, can make even the perfectly planned trip take a turn for the worst. Pick snacks that keep you feeling great while still effectively keeping hunger at bay. This advice comes with the obvious exclusion for your favorite candy, however, which you are encouraged to eat in moderation! </p><br/><p>Road trips have the potential to be some of the most epic journeys we will take in life. Hitting the road with a well thought out plan and seeing the country by car is one of the great American traditions that has withstood the test of time. To maximize your fun and limit the risk that your trip goes south, be sure to do your homework and plan using the tips outlined here. Now get out there, see the world, and don\'t forget to take pictures! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 24],

By creating content that provides value to your audience and engages them, you give people a reason to stick around and pay attention. Remember, most people are spending time on social to engage with content that is valuable to them for one reason or another; your job is to provide that value! </p><br/><br/><h2>Use Hashtags Wisely</h2><br/><p>Spending the time to include meaningful hashtags to your posts can have a dramatic effect on how many people see it. Target hashtags that you think your target audience will be searching for. Like a directory or index, hashtags are a tool people use to find new content. If you don\'t do the groundwork to make sure your content appears in people\'s feed, they will have a much harder time finding you. </p><br/><br/><h2>Interact With Others</h2><br/><p>Just like hashtags, reaching out and engaging with other accounts is critical to your growth on a social platform. By commenting and adding value to other people\'s posts who\'s account is similar to yours, you allow yourself to be seen not only by that account but also by anyone looking at the comments. Replying to the comments of a potential follower is an extremely effective way of getting their attention! </p><br/><br/><h2>Be Consistent</h2><br/><p>If you are building an audience from the ground up, one of the most important things to realize is that it will not happen overnight. Your growth will come slowest at first, so it\'s essential to keep that in mind, or you risk getting discouraged. Put together a schedule for posting new content and interacting with others, then stick to it. Consistency is what matters here; the results will work themselves out over time if you put in the work. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>In a world where we are increasingly looking at our phone screens for the connection we crave, social media platforms have become an incubator for those looking to grow their brand and influence. The beauty of it all is that there are truly people out there who share your same interests, whatever they are, and are looking for new content to consume. Put in the work consistently, and it could be you they are looking to as the authority figure!</p>', 'image_id' => 26],

Here\'s a beginner\'s guide to the world of facebook advertising!', 'excerpt' => 'Here are the basics to get you started in the right direction and have you running effective ads in no time.', 'body' => '<p>Social media and the hyper-connected world it has facilitated have made advertising opportunities more abundant and powerful than ever before. People are paying more attention to their social feeds than ever before, and the result is that advertisements are more prevalent than ever. Arguably the most powerful of these social platforms for the sake of advertising is Facebook. With over 2.5 billion monthly active users, Facebook has capitalized on the attention, as well as the plethora of information they have on their users, to build a world-class advertising platform that is, arguably, the most powerful to ever exist. </p><br/><br/><p>Are you looking to grow your business or project by harnessing the power of Facebook advertising, but don\'t know where to start? Here are the basics to get you started in the right direction and have you running effective ads in no time. </p><br/><br/><h2>Identify Your Goals</h2><br/><p>Facebook advertising allows you to accomplish a wide variety of business goals. Are you looking to build awareness of your product or brand? Perhaps you are looking to drive traffic of interested leads to your website with the hopes that some of them will buy what you are selling? Regardless of your primary purpose for running the ads, Facebook likely has an efficient way to accomplish it. Reflect on what exactly you are hoping to achieve first, and you will most effectively spend your ad dollars from the start. </p><br/><br/><h2>Identify Your Ideal Customer</h2><br/><p>One of the most incredible features of the Facebook ad platform is the unparalleled ability to target the audience you want to see your ad. Consider the not too distant past when you would see ads for an elderly male medication, even if you were a young female. This is no longer the case, as you can target your ads to only show to very specific, niche groups of people. Who is most likely to be interested in what you are advertising? Get granular and be amazed at the strength of your results.</p><br/><br/><h2>Create Attractive Offer</h2><br/><p>One of the not-so-secret facts about advertising is that you have to bait your audience in to some degree. Catching the attention of someone seeing your ad often comes at the result of some discount or special offer, a cost that can easily be made up if you structure the deal correctly. The wormless hook catches no fish, and so too, your ad will fall on deaf ears if you haven\'t sweetened the deal in one way or another. </p><br/><br/><h2>Budget And Test </h2><br/><p>The icing on the Facebook ad cake is that you can split test an almost unlimited number of times. First, consider your budget and decide how much you are willing to spend testing for the ideal ad campaigns. Then, split that money up into running many variations of the same ad, except for one main difference. Keep the ad that performs better for you and continue testing different aspects of that ad. Eventually, the testing will boil down your effort into a campaign of tested and proven ad creative that will give you the best returns on your investment. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Facebook advertising is leading the charge into a new age for advertisements. The social platform, and others like it, have revolutionized how effective ads can be by allowing you to target your ideal audience for pennies on the dollar compared to more traditional mediums. Hop on and start a few campaigns, you will be amazed at the depths of this marketing gold mine. </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 27],

Whether it be looking at a TV, computer, or phone, we will collectively rack up more hours of screen time in 2020 than ever before. While it is clear that life is drastically more convenient and efficient than ever before, what is less obvious is the toll that the additional screen time is having on our health. It turns out that the blue light emitted from your phone is not only causing significant disruptions to your sleep but can also cause disease (1). </p><br/><p>So, what is blue light, and how can we best protect ourselves without having to make the sacrifices that come with the reduced usage of some of our lives\' most essential devices? </p><br/><h2>What\'s The Deal With Blue Light? </h2><br/><p>Blue light refers to the specific blue wavelengths that are coming through our device screens. Interestingly, each color of light has a slightly different effect on our brain as we process it. During the day, blue light is processed by our mind as a signal that increases mood and attention. The problem comes after the sun has set, though, when this same blue light suppresses melatonin, a hormone that our body creates to regulate sleep cycles. Without normal levels of melatonin the body is missing the essential signals telling it to prepare for and eventually fall asleep. Repeated exposure to blue light in the evenings can lead to more severe sleep problems. (1) </p><br/><p>Beyond problematic sleep issues, blue light can also be straining on the eyes and cause painful headaches (particularly at night!). Some studies have also shown that repeated exposure to blue light has longer-term health consequences, including links to diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. (1)</p><br/><p>Because of the myriad of potential health problems, both in the short and long term, it is clear that blue light (or rather the reduction of) should be a priority for everyone. </p><br/><h2>So, What Can We Do about it? </h2><br/><p>Luckily, there are a number of solutions that can significantly reduce our exposure to harmful blue light and allow us to rack up screen time without all of the adverse side effects. </p><br/><h2>1) Blue Light Glasses</h2><br/><p>Blue light glasses come in a variety of styles and work by utilizing a lens that filters out all of the blue wavelengths of light. These are available in both prescription and regular lenses! </p><br/><h2>2) Screen Covers </h2><br/><p>Screen covers are an excellent choice for your laptop, desktop, or even phone screen! Convenient to either use or easily set to the side, these covers are affordable and come in a tremendous variety of sizes. </p><br/><h2>3) Phone Apps</h2><br/><p>Apps like f.lux are changing the game, allowing you to adjust your screen light settings to filter out blue wavelengths and replacing it with a slightly more subdued color. Best of all, it\'s free! </p><br/><p>Blue light and more broadly screen time, in general, is the unfortunate and dangerous byproduct of a more convenient and connected life. Of course, the most obvious solution would be to cut down or even abandon our screen time, but to do so would pretty clearly pose its own set of problems. We are left then, to adapt to our new \"normal\" and adjust our strategy. It\'s scary to consider that many don\'t know the potential harm they are doing to themselves, and unfortunate that the problem is also easily solved! </p><br/><p>What are you doing to protect yourself and your loved ones?</p>', 'image_id' => 28],

I realize that may seem a little dramatic and overstated, but I believe it to be true. The fact that anyone can broadcast information, free of charge, and in the long-form has created a breakthrough in how information is shared. If you\'ve paid attention to our pop culture, you have likely already realized this, as podcasts have erupted in recent years as one of the fastest-growing mediums we share information. A glance through the searchable libraries of any podcast player (there are many), and you will find more information than you could realistically listen to on any topic you can think of. </p><br/><br/><p>One of the most significant benefits of listening to podcasts over more traditional media types is that you don\'t need to focus your conscious attention on reading or to watch anything in particular to enjoy them. The fact that you can listen, sometimes for hours at a time, without having to change the channel or give up your focus from elsewhere.</p><br/><br/><p>Here are the biggest podcast hacks I have found that has changed the game as far as how I can entertain myself better than ever and learn new information more efficiently than ever before!</p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Beat Boredom During My Commute </h2><br/><p>Driving can be draining because it requires that you focus your attention on the road. This makes it pretty tough to do much of anything else, until now. By listening to podcasts while I am driving, I can entertain myself without having to take my eyes off of the car in front of me. My trips to and from work go faster than ever, as podcasts engage my brain and pass the time so much more effectively than music ever did. </p><br/><br/><h2>The Best Way To Cook And Clean </h2><br/><p>Podcasts have revolutionized the way that I look at common house chores. Traditionally I was never fond of things like cooking dinner or doing the dishes because they took away from the time that would otherwise be used to unwind and relax after a long day. I may not be able to kick my feet up and watch tv while I have food on the stove or soapy hands doing the dishes, but I can use my ears to have a good laugh listening to my favorite comedy show. </p><br/><br/><h2>Work Outs Fly By </h2><br/><p>Getting out the door for a run or hitting the gym are sometimes hard to find the motivation for. The beat of even my favorite music can become predictable, and so using it as a distraction to keep me from focusing on the burning feeling in my legs only works for so long. Podcasts have changed this, though, as I can engage with the ideas I hear on a much deeper level than the lyrics to a song can provide fuel for. </p><br/><br/><h2>Rest Comes Quickly </h2><br/><p>Falling asleep has been a pretty tall order for me in the past. My brain likes to race at night instead of slow down, which leads me to toss and turn while I should be getting quality sleep. Luckily, some podcasts engage me enough to listen, but quickly have me fast asleep. Podcasts that discuss things like history can fascinate me for just long enough to keep my mind off of the day\'s stresses and lull me to sleep. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>As you can see, podcasts can serve you at times other forms of media may not be suitable or even possible. The fact that anyone can create and upload a podcast has created a library of content that genuinely fits every occasion. From navigating traffic to falling asleep, the opportunity to enhance your life is only a click away. The only question now is, what will you listen to first? </p>', 'image_id' => 29],

Chances are, though, that you\'ve used the video hosting website far more often than that. The rise of the internet has allowed for just about anyone to become famous and leave their mark on the world as a person of influence on the masses. It\'s also not a secret that many of the youtube stars of today are making hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars off of their followings, all without ever selling anything. Youtube pays content creators based on the number of views their content receives, which means that if you can build a following, you too can strike it rich and give up your day job for good. </p><br/><br/><p>Sounds like a pretty sweet deal, right? We thought so, too. After years of research and a moderately successful channel of my own, here are the five steps you can follow to build your channel on Youtube. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Stick To A Topic You Are Passionate About</h2><br/><p>The quickest way to build a following on Youtube is by creating content that will keep your audience coming back. To do this, you should make sure you pick a subject to base your channel around that you know a lot about and have a passion for. Pumping out content is easier, and comes across more genuine if you find enjoyment in what you are doing. From the audience\'s point of view, content that follows a theme or topic is more enticing to follow than a channel that jumps around too much. Your audience wants consistency! </p><br/><br/><h2>Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable</h2><br/><p>It\'s not rocket science to understand that to become famous on Youtube; you will need to spend a lot of time on camera. What many people fail to keep in mind is that by putting yourself out there, you are signing yourself up for some criticism. You\'ll need to quickly develop a thick skin and learn to be comfortable on camera, regardless of what your haters are saying. </p><br/><br/><h2>Create Valuable Content </h2><br/><p>Content that keeps people coming back provides value. It could be educational, entertaining, or something unique, but to get your audience to come back and seek out more videos in the future, there has to be something in it for them. Focus on putting out quality content, and the rest will fall into place. </p><br/><br/><h2>Pick The Right Titles</h2><br/><p>The title and description of your video are so much more important than a lot of people realize. Think of it this way, you could have the best content in the world, but if nobody can find it amongst the millions of other videos, it will go largely unnoticed. Pick descriptive, catchy titles that hint at the actual content of the blog, but try to be specific. Showing up for \"weight loss\" will be a lot harder than showing up for \"how to eat cantaloupe and lose 40 pounds in 3 weeks.\" </p><br/><br/><h2>Consistency</h2><br/><p>This is the most important advice I can give regarding Youtube or most things in life worth doing. The uncomfortable truth is that you will likely require a bit (or a lot!) of practice before you are making content people want to watch. Push through the first few months regardless of if you are gaining any traction. Getting the ball rolling is the hardest part, but once you do, it\'s all downhill from there. </p><br/><br/><p>Building a following on Youtube and becoming the next internet star is no small order, but can be done if you stick to the plan outlined above. Every day more people are catching onto this opportunity and turning their passions into a serious paycheck. What do you love talking about? Chances are there are a huge number of people that are interested and would love to hear what you have to say. The only question now is, when will you start? </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 30],

Praised in the article for everything from it\'s a plethora of choices for recreation to its friendliness for electric vehicles, it\'s easy to see how this beautiful city in the southwestern corner of the US is a must-see tourist destination. Add to it the fact that San Diego has some of the best year-round weather in the country, if not the world, and it\'s no surprise the home of Ron Burgundy has people flocking to it every year. </p><br/><br/><p>Perhaps the most challenging part of San Diego is deciding how to spend your time while there. After all, there\'s so much to do! Having lived in San Diego for almost a decade, I have fielded this infamous vacation question a lot and have boiled down everything I think a visitor should know. Here are some hidden secrets you might otherwise miss. </p><br/><br/><h2>1) There Are Mountains, Too! </h2><br/><p>San Diego is widely known for having incredible beaches and world-class surf. The sands of Pacific Beach, Coronado, and La Jolla are rightfully well known and celebrated, and, if surfing is your thing, Black\'s beach is a must! What many people don\'t realize, though, is that San Diego\'s nearby mountains are equally impressive! Taking a short 45-minute drive east from Downtown will bring you to Mount Laguna, a quaint mountain town with some of the most spectacular alpine mountain scenery in Southern California. Check out the Pacific Crest Trail and be wowed with stunning vistas as the mountains fall steeply to the desert floor thousands of feet below.</p><br/><br/><h2>2)Take A Historical Deep Dive</h2><br/><p>San Diego is known as an extremely progressive west coast city that pushes the envelope in ways the rest of the country will eventually follow. All of that innovation and open-mindedness doesn\'t mean we lack history, though! San Diego was the landing point of the first European expedition to explore the western half of the country. Check out where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his men landed and learn the history of San Diego\'s settlement, all with stunning views of the city and bay, at Cabrillo National Monument. Only a 10-minute drive from downtown, this hidden gem in San Diego will give you a birds-eye view of the city layout as well as a deep understanding of our history.</p><br/><br/><h2>3) Refuel With Authentic Mexican Food</h2><br/><p>You may be wondering why Mexican food is on my list of secrets for San Diego. It\'s a fair question. Most visitors to our city understand that the border with Mexico is only a 20-minute drive from downtown and correctly assumes that tacos are a must while they are visiting. Many people don\'t understand, though, that the most authentic tastes of our neighbor to the south are hiding in plain sight. In San Diego, the general rule should be that if it looks like a hole in the wall, typically, it\'s going to be excellent. Chain restaurants will usually fall short to the mom and pop shops where generations of family recipes are on their side. Don\'t forget to try a California burrito or adobada in your taco! </p><br/><br/><br/><p>The best part of a vacation somewhere new is exploring the city and discovering the things that speak to you. These are just a couple of helpful hints that I see most people miss. Perhaps the best part of San Diego is how friendly the people are, so if you find yourself wanting a suggestion, just ask a local! </p><br/><br/><p>See you around town!</p><br/>', 'image_id' => 31],

Luckily, in San Diego, we have a 7,000-acre park right in our back yard. Mission Trails Regional Park is a collection of rugged hills, exposed desert, and five challenging peaks to climb. The park is accessible from multiple sides, making it convenient no matter which part of town you are traveling from. (1)</p><br/><br/><h2>30 Minutes - Torrey Pines State Reserve</h2><br/><p>If you have a long morning or afternoon free, spending it at Torrey Pines is an excellent choice. About 30 minutes north of downtown, Torrey Pines is a 2000 acre coastal park with incredible views and a variety of walking paths and trails to explore. My favorite way to enjoy the beauty of Torrey Pines is to arrive in the late afternoon, taking my time to meander down to the beach just as the sun is setting. You can walk the beach about a mile back to the parking lot, plenty of time to enjoy the stunning cliff lines and other coastal scenery. (2)</p><br/><br/><h2>1 Hour - Mount Laguna </h2><br/><p>If you are looking for a more challenging hike and have the day to slow down and enjoy yourself, do yourself a favor and take the one hour trip up to Mount Laguna. The freeway quickly turns to a two-lane highway, which follows switchbacks up to the small mountain town of Mount Laguna. Boasting little more than a general store, a single restaurant, and a fire station, Mount Laguna is nestled on the top of San Diego County\'s highest mountain range. Follow the Pacific Crest Trail north and experience stunning mountainscapes as cliffs plummet thousands of feet to the desert floor below. You can see for miles, and at night the stars are amazing.

Airline tickets are expensive, and vacation days are limited; don\'t set yourself up to potentially miss the flight. Arrive at least an hour and a half early, and budget time for traffic on your way even if navigation says otherwise. </p><br/><br/><h2>Charge Your Phone</h2><br/><p>A day of travel can be made significantly more stressful if you are watching your phone slowly breath it\'s last breaths. Phones have become a tool for major convenience and entertainment while traveling, but only if they have the battery to be used to their fullest. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Download Your Boarding Pass</h2><br/><p>Major airlines all have their own apps in 2020, allowing you to check-in and even access your boarding pass without the burdensome check-in line. Don\'t risk losing the slips of paper as you navigate security; your phone is harder to lose and stores a boarding pass better than your pocket. </p><br/><br/><h2>Get Precheck </h2><br/><p>TSA has offered precheck for quite some time, but for some reason, many travelers have yet to sign up for it. Why wait in line for longer than you need to? Precheck will cut down on your trip anxiety by allowing you to skip the security line and pass through to your gate without the wait. </p><br/><br/><h2>Plan Your Next Move </h2><br/><p>Do you have a plan after you land at your destination? Arranging your ride and knowing where you need to go will make your arrival so much smoother than it might otherwise be. Do the research ahead of time, so you don\'t run into any surprises. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Stick to the above travel hacks, and you will be amazed at how painless it can be to travel. Having the opportunity to see different parts of the world is a blessing, it would be foolish to pass up on, but for many, the process of getting there is just too much. Don\'t be one of these people! Stick to the plan while navigating airports, and you will unlock the power of stress-free travel. Bon Voyage! </p>', 'image_id' => 33],

Nestled in the middle of the beach is the world-famous Hotel Del Coronado, an upscale resort that serves as an excellent nav point and place to explore on its own. This beach is best enjoyed at sunset with your loved ones, make sure you stop in the upscale downtown district for dinner or a drink before you leave. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Best surf (er) Vibes</h2><br/><p>Ocean Beach is one of the closest beaches to downtown and is nestled where the 8 Freeway and the ocean meet. A funky, eclectic beach town, OB (as it is affectionately known by locals) is said to be one of the last well-preserved hippie beach towns where time has stood still since the \'60s. The surf here is equally groovy, as surfers from all over the city (and world) flock here to surf the jetty, pier, and cliffs. Speaking of the pier, the pier there is the longest walking pier on the West Coast and has a seafood restaurant about halfway out. (1) </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Best Boardwalk and Parties</h2><br/><p>Mission Beach and Pacific Beach are the next beaches north from Ocean Beach, and together make up a three mile stretch of sand and surf. The most prominent feature of the beach is the double-wide pedestrian boardwalk that stretches the entire three miles, lined mostly with college students, young professionals, and vacation rentals. The boardwalk works as a perfect transportation system between the two beach towns, both of which feature prominant streets lined with bars and restaurants. Be sure to hang on to your hat; there\'s a lot of fun to be had here. (2)</p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Best Family-Friendly Fun</h2><br/><p>If you are looking for a place to take your little ones, or, in general, would just like a more family-friendly and relaxed atmosphere, then the La Jolla Beaches are perfect. This upscale neighborhood is home to many families and is, in general, about as clean and cookie-cutter as San Diego gets. There are a variety of smaller beaches that dot the coastline, all of which will likely have other families enjoying the sunshine. If seeing wildlife sounds fun, a walk down to La Jolla Cove (located in the middle of downtown) to see the sea lions is sure to entertain. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>As someone that has enjoyed the beaches of San Diego for many years, I especially love that there really is a beach for every situation. With so many days of sunshine each year, there\'s plenty of time to enjoy them all. If you have the time, visit them all! Otherwise, I hope this guide helps you find your own fun in the sun, whatever that looks like.</p><br/>', 'image_id' => 35],

Here\'s what gear to spend money on first.', 'excerpt' => 'Here\'s a list of the equipment I found to be most vital to my comfort in the backcountry; these are the items I relied on day in and day out.', 'body' => '<p>The world of backpacking can unlock some of the most beautiful places on earth. Often to see the most spectacular vistas where mother nature is truly at her best, you have to travel beyond where the roads end. Traveling to these places on foot can truly be spiritual; spending time in nature and away from the hustle and bustle connects us to our most authentic selves. Being comfortable in these spaces enough to fully enjoy them can be a life-changing experience. </p><br/><br/><p>In 2015 I hiked the entirety of the Pacific Crest Trail, a continuous footpath that follows the tallest mountains on the west coast as they span from Mexico to Canada. Fully experiencing this trail of over 2600 miles took me almost six months, plenty of time to fully develop an understanding of what gear is most critical for being comfortable outside. Here\'s a list of the equipment I found to be most vital to my comfort in the backcountry; these are the items I relied on day in and day out. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Backpack </h2><br/><p>It should come as no surprise that investing in a quality pack should be an enormous priority. You will be carrying everything you need with you day after day. Having a backpack that fits you well, can hold up to the elements, and is the correct size is monumentally important. </p><br/><br/><h2>Sleep System </h2><br/><p>The sleep system includes a sleeping bag and pad. Consider how essential being comfortable is to quality sleep, and then how important it will be to wake up feeling refreshed. The sleeping pad is of equal importance to the bag; it insulates you from the cold ground and protects you from rocks, roots, and more. </p><br/><br/><h2>Tent</h2><br/><p>Your tent will be your shelter from the storm, maybe literally, and will quickly become your safe place in the backcountry. The further you are from your car or a warm hotel, the more important having a quality, dependable tent becomes. Find the right balance between the size you\'d like and the weight you are willing to carry.</p><br/><br/><h2>Layers</h2><br/><p>Having the right layers for your trip can make or break your enjoyment of the time you have to spend in nature. Do your research on the typical weather in the area during the time of year you will be there and plan to have high quality and appropriate clothing. Having something warm enough for while you are at camp and a dependable rain jacket to keep you dry during the day are excellent pieces of gear to start with. </p><br/><br/><h2>Water Filter</h2><br/><p>Nothing is more uncomfortable than not having clean water to drink. Not only can untreated water contain deadly bacteria, but it can taste awful as well! Imagine coming across the water source you are relying on and finding a dead bird floating in it. I can tell you from experience that\'s the last time I relied on iodine to purify! Investing in a quality water filter will give you the peace of mind to explore further than you otherwise would! </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Backpacking gear can be expensive, and it\'s hard to know where to start when it comes to spending the money on the best equipment. These are the first things I would invest in were I to rebuild my gear starting from scratch. Rest assured that the higher price tags will ensure a quality you can rely on and a lifespan that will afford you many future trips to the great outdoors. </p><br/><br/><p>Happy Trails! </p>', 'image_id' => 36],

For those that live in San Diego, getting out to enjoy the surroundings that make their home so special borders on an obligation, with time inside often coming with a fair bit of guilt. Having lived in San Diego for long enough to call it home, I\'ve had the opportunity to capitalize on the heaping loads of incredible weather, and in the process, have narrowed down what I believe are the best places to spend a day in the sun. The following outdoor spaces are sure to leave you wondering if you can stay forever, and, best yet, they are within 15 minutes of downtown. This convenient reality means that they are close enough that they can be considered an option even if life has other plans for the majority of your day. </p><br/><br/><h2>Balboa Park</h2><br/><p>Balboa Park is a 1,200-acre oasis of culture tucked only minutes from the center of the city. More extensive than Central Park in New York, Balboa park boasts everything from gardens and green spaces to museums and a zoo. The best news? There are walking paths throughout this enormous park, meaning you can spend an entire day there without ever having to get in the car! </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Ocean Beach Fishing Pier </h2><br/><p>The Ocean Beach Fishing Pier is truly a sight to behold. Tucked along the shores of the sleepy, hippy-influenced beach town of Ocean Beach, the walking pier stretches out into the sea an astonishing 1971 feet. Take a stroll out to the end, admiring the dedication of the many fishermen hoping to pull in a lunker along the way, and enjoy some of the best views of San Diego\'s vast coastline. Stop on your walk back for a snack at the pier\'s restaurant, serving up seafood that may have recently been swimming just below you! </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Mission Trails </h2><br/><p>Comprised of over 7,000 acres of protected land, the foothills and coastal desert ecosystems of San Diego, which existed well before people are excellently showcased here. With seemingly endless trail miles at your fingertips, you could easily spend a day here exploring all that the park has to offer. Up for a challenge? Try to touch the five major peaks in the park in one day, recognized by the park as the Five Peak Challenge! </p><br/><br/><h2>Cabrillo Monument </h2><br/><p>Cabrillo Monument is the California Historical Landmark that protects the southern tip of the Point Loma Peninsula. This stip of land jetting out from San Diego Bay is the landing point for the first European settlers, led by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, as they came to America to settle and explore the West Coast. Preserved to be just as it was discovered in 1542, the park highlights not only the ecosystem but also pays tribute to the military history of the area and the point\'s famous lighthouse. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>San Diego and its propensity for sunshine mean that it is the perfect city to get outside and explore. Luckily, there is no shortage of ways to spend a day in the sunshine without traveling too far from the city. Don\'t miss your opportunity to see the sights and enjoy the weather in America\'s greatest city. </p>', 'image_id' => 37],

Considered the little sister city to Chicago, Milwaukee sits on the western shores of Lake Michigan and has its roots as a blue-collar city. Milwaukee is most known for its freezing, harsh winters, a plethora of large national breweries, most notably including Miller and Pabst, and a huge variety of friendly people anxious to make you feel welcome in their home town. </p><br/><br/><p>Getting to Milwaukee isn\'t overly difficult, Michell International Airport is only a stone throw away from the downtown district and flights are relatively cheap, especially into O\'hare. (an additional 45 minutes south.) Milwaukee is also an excellent place to explore, the cost of living (and vacationing) is cheap and, as mentioned before, the city, and it\'s cheery inhabitants love playing host to out-of-town guests. </p><br/><br/><p>As someone that grew up in Milwaukee and spent the first 22 years of my life there, I not only developed a deep appreciation for Milwaukee but also got to know it very well too. To hopefully dispell any misunderstanding that Milwaukee is not worth a visit, I\'ve put together what I would consider to be the ultimate way to spend a day (or two!) in this beautiful Midwestern city. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Cheese, Brats, And Breweries </h2><br/><p>It won\'t take long for anyone visiting this city by the lake to realize it\'s residents take their food and drink extremely seriously. Maybe its the cold winter or the massive amount of dairy produced there, but cheese and beer are unofficially the city\'s delicacy. Be sure to stop in a restaurant like Cafe Hollander to sample the local supply. If you are a beer drinker, it is also worth the time (and potential liver damage) to take a tour of one of the cities famous breweries. Lakefront Brewery is a local favorite for their unlimited sampling rule during the tour. Stick around after and enjoy a fish fry! </p><br/><br/><h2>The Lake Effect</h2><br/><p>Assuming you will visit during a time of year that is not winter, the lake is an absolute must. When I say \"the lake,\" I am lovingly referring to Lake Michigan, one of the great lakes and the body of water that dominates Milwaukee\'s geography. The saying \"cooler by the lake\" describes the weather effect the body of water has during the summer, but symbolically it holds equal weight. In the summertime, the lakefront is the place to be, any of the cultural festivals on the Summerfest grounds are highly recommended!</p><br/><br/><h2>Watch The Wings Flap</h2><br/><p>The most striking architecture in Milwaukee, and arguably the midwest, belongs to the Calatrava Art Museum. Designed by Santiago Calatrava, the world-renowned museum is shaped like a bird in flight. The wings to the bird, which are hundreds of feet long and almost as tall, actually flap in unison together. See local favorites like \"The Janitor\" sculpture or check out one of the continually touring worldwide exhibits that make a stop. (1)</p><br/><br/><h2>Cheer On The Local Favorites</h2><br/><p>One thing that I\'ve been told people recognize quickly about the city of Milwaukee is how passionate the locals are about their sports teams. The truth is that while Milwaukee is an excellent place to visit, living there can be tough, especially in the winter months. The Brewers baseball and Bucks basketball teams provide entertainment throughout the year, and the stadiums are located within a short drive of anywhere in the downtown area. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Milwaukee is a unique and welcoming city that is undoubtedly worth the visit if you are looking for a new city to explore. Affectionately loved by the people that live there, I have no doubt you will understand why. The beer is cheap, and the cheese is world-class, but as you\'ll learn, that\'s just the tip of the iceberg as to what makes Milwaukee great. </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 38],

You know what you are worth, why don\'t your prospective employers? </p><br/><br/><p>If you can relate, perhaps you are even in the midst of this storm currently, then I have excellent news for you. As someone that has walked in those shoes several times throughout my life, I finally cracked the job search code. Here is the process I have used to land a number of excellent opportunities... without the headache. </p><br/><br/><h2>Take A Realistic Browse </h2><br/><p>The first step to securing your next job is to take a good look at what is available. Decide on where you are willing to work; are you ready to commute or even move? It\'s essential to find opportunities you feel confident in your ability to do well, as that confidence (or lack thereof) will come across in an interview. Worry less about the short term pay and more about the opportunity for growth doing something you enjoy. </p><br/><br/><h2>Refresh Your Resume </h2><br/><p>The resume will be the front line for your job search; it\'s the first \"look\" your prospective employer will have. It\'s important to realize that most jobs receive dozens, if not hundreds of applicants. Your resume will be compared against many others. Highlight experiences you\'ve had that makes you an excellent candidate for the job listing specifically. Create a unique resume for each position that has its own set of desirables. </p><br/><br/><h2>Cast A Wide Net</h2><br/><p>Casting a wide net is essential to finding the fish. As mentioned above, your resume will likely be one of many for the same position. Try not to take it personally if you don\'t hear back from MOST jobs you apply for. Even the best applicants can slip through the cracks. Look at your job applications as a job in itself, and cast your net wide to maximize your interviews and potential job offers. More is almost always better in this case. </p><br/><br/><h2>Jump On Every Opportunity </h2><br/><p>If a prospective employer reaches out to you for an interview, it is best to take it! Even if you don\'t love the job or think it\'s realistic, practicing your interview skills will hone your craft and allow you to practice articulating your strengths in a pressure environment. Accept that you may botch some of your interviews, it happens to everyone! There will always be more opportunities down the line, and your lessons learned today may be what scores you the chance of a lifetime down the road. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>The job search process is, for most people, kind of like taxes. It\'s not first on the list of favorites, but in the end, it\'s an integral part of moving forward in the world as you chase your dreams. Consistency will carry you through so long as you are genuine in your pursuit to find opportunities that will help you grow in your passions. </p>', 'image_id' => 39],

Originating in India, the practice of yoga has been utilized as a potent methodology for taking care and prioritizing the health of both body and mind.

Yoga may be precisely what you are looking for! Like most things worth doing in life, the hardest part of starting yoga for me was building the confidence to show up for that first class. Dozens of classes later, I can say somewhat humorously that I am still a beginner but have learned enough that I feel confident in pointing newcomers in the right direction as far as where to start. </p><br/><br/><p>Here are the most important things I have learned about yoga since beginning my practice that will get you off on the right foot. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>It\'s As Much Mental As Physical</h2><br/><p>There is no denying that many of the positions in yoga can be very challenging for newcomers. Some require a high degree of mobility through the joints, as well as the ability to stabilize and balance muscles you may have never engaged before. I think most people have a good understanding of this coming in. What I didn\'t realize, and I can\'t imagine I\'m in the minority here, is that yoga is at least as challenging mentally. The truth is that holding the positions asked of you in yoga requires you to sit in discomfort, sometimes for minutes at a time. During these moments it\'s common to get frustrated and irritable. Don\'t worry; it\'s all part of the process!</p><br/><br/><br/><h2>It All Comes Down To Breathing</h2><br/><p>Maintaining a steady inhale and exhale of your breath is critical to your yoga practice. Instructors will often mention this in class, but what may not be as obvious is that even something as simple as breathing takes practice! Just as your mobility will improve over time, your ability to breathe through and find comfort in the stretches will be a work in progress. If you feel lost in class, return to a comfortable pose and fall back into your breath... fill your belly first! </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Consistency Is Everything</h2><br/><p>Throughout your practice you will have good classes and bad classes. You will have days where you feel you made a ton of progress and others where it feels like you have taken ten steps in the wrong direction. It\'s essential not to get too caught up in either of these ends of the spectrum. In reality, your body will be more apt to stretch and bend some days than others. You might be ready to focus one day and find yourself in the zone, only to return the next day and have it all fall apart. The trick to yoga seems to be showing up regardless of how your last class went with the faith that the next class will be exactly what you need that day, regardless of if it feels that way. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Yoga will challenge you in ways you didn\'t realize, hopefully allowing you to harness an inner strength and poise you didn\'t know you had. Stick with it when times get tough, and don\'t forget to appreciate the moments when it all clicks. Taking time to focus on yourself, physically and mentally, is a victory in an of itself. </p><br/><br/><p>See you on your mat in class! </p><br/>', 'image_id' => 40],

It should go without saying, then, that your choice in mattress is a hugely significant decision. Now you may be thinking, aren\'t all mattresses pretty much the same? If this is you, then consider yourself lucky for never having to spend the night tossing and turning only to slog through the best moments of the following day. </p><br/><p>So, what are the most important considerations you should pay attention to as you are shopping for a new mattress? Here are the five most significant pieces of advice to keep in mind.</p><br/><br/><h2>1) Bigger is (usually) better! </h2><br/><p>When shopping for a mattress, the saying that \"bigger is better\" really rings true. The reality is that there is nothing worse when you are trying to sleep than feeling like you are constricted and unable to move. If you share the bed, consider prioritizing the space for at least a queen-sized mattress. Even if you don\'t currently share your bed with a partner, there\'s a good chance that you will at some point before you would otherwise have to replace it. Just make sure it\'s going to fit and take measurements, including space to easily move around it first!</p><br/><br/><h2>2) Do Your Research </h2><br/><p>There is an enormous number of choices when it comes to buying a new mattress. As with anything in life, some options are better quality than others. The actual quality is not always reflected in the price, however, and so you will likely come across deals that seem great but end up being too good to be true. Don\'t be someone that falls for it! Make sure to do your research on any brand (especially newer start-up brands) and read plenty of reviews online. </p><br/><br/><h2>3) Find The Genuine Article</h2><br/><p>Just as some mattress brands advertise themselves as a premium product only to leave their customers regularly disappointed, there also seems to be a growing trend in the number of counterfeit mattresses sold by individual vendors on websites like Craigslist and Offerup. Major brands like Tempurpedic that charge a premium for their quality product are most susceptible to impersonators, who will lure customers in claiming to be selling the genuine article for as much as 80% off. Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on buying it from a trusted source. (1) </p><br/><br/><h2>4) Invest In Your Future</h2><br/><p>We already recognize just how critical sleep is, but did you know that innerspring and memory foam mattresses have a lifespan of 8-10 years? (2) The mattress decision you make today will be something you sleep on (literally!) almost every day for approximately the next decade. Our advice? Take the time to save some money if you have to, but give yourself the gift of great sleep and invest in a quality mattress. </p><br/><br/><h2>5) Try Before You Buy</h2><br/><p>You could read a huge number of mattress reviews online, but the truth is that everyone is going to have their unique preferences when it comes to mattresses. What feels like sleeping on a rock to some may be too soft for others, and the choice of memory foam vs. innerspring is also personal. The best strategy includes a trip to the mattress store so that you can try before you buy! Also, don\'t forget to take advantage of most mattresses companies\' offers to a money-back guarantee. </p><br/><br/><p>Knowing these concepts will leave you ahead of the curve in your mattress shopping experience.

Let\'s face it, though, the execution of it all can be tough. There are several different hurdles you will need to get sorted out before your site pops and is ready for visitors, all of which can intimidate you enough not to get started. Take this blog, for instance! While this is a clean and polished work of art (I know, so humble), I would be lying if I said it was smooth sailing to get here. The truth is that everyone who starts a blog comes across a similar set of roadblocks that have to address before it feels like you have something worth committing to. To help you share your creativity with the world, I\'ve put together a no-nonsense guide to getting started when it comes to blogging. Follow these simple tips, and you will have a platform to participate in one of the most satisfying (and potentially profitable) new ways to express yourself online. </p><br/><br/><h2>Pick A Theme</h2><br/><p>The first step to starting a blog is to decide what you are going to talk about! This isn\'t a hard and fast requirement, but, in general, it is a good idea if you\'d like to build an audience that comes back regularly. Blogs that touch on specific topics, even if those are varied, will be more successful at building a loyal following. If you want to drive consistent traffic to your blog and share your ideas with the world, this is a critical step. Don\'t get too caught up on defining what the topics are. Instead, have a sense of the direction you want your content to go and speak to the people who are likely to read it. </p><br/><br/><h2>Build A Platform </h2><br/><p>The next step is to create a digital home for your content online. You could have an incredible library of beautifully written content, but if it\'s not hosted somewhere, people can find it, then it serves little purpose. Especially when you are first starting, it\'s important to keep things simple. By using a straightforward website builder like Wix or Squarespace, you keep the complicated coding out of it and will have a platform to speak from before you know it. The best news is it\'s affordable, too! </p><br/><br/><h2>Outline Your Post First </h2><br/><p>Writer\'s block is something that everyone who blogs will deal with occasionally. Most commonly, this frustrating state of not knowing what to say comes from not having spent the time putting together your thoughts loosely, first. Write the outline for your first few articles without any concern for how it sounds. Right now, you are just getting the ideas on paper; turning it to written gold comes next. </p><br/><br/><h2>Take A Crack At The Real Thing</h2><br/><p>Once your outlines are done, and you have a good idea of what you\'d like to say, it\'s time to put in the work to make the blog posts come alive. The beauty of a blog is that there are no hard and fast rules you must stick to. Write in a way that is engaging and easy to read, but most importantly, find your voice. Your audience will return again and again when they feel like they can connect with you through your writing. Just be yourself! </p><br/><br/><h2>Seek Feedback </h2><br/><p>It can be frustrating to receive feedback on your writing, especially a blog that is meant to be your own but doing so will drastically improve your content. The simple fact is that you don\'t know what you don\'t know, and this is especially true with your writing. Another set of eyes will catch things you might miss and should have good feedback as to how you can deliver your message better. Don\'t take it personally; it is all part of the process! </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>There you have it! Follow this process, and in no time at all, you can have a blog you are proud of. Like so many things in life, consistency is key, and with practice, you will continue to polish and get better. Stick with it, and don\'t forget why you started; this is supposed to be fun! Best of luck and happy blogging, I hope to stumble across your site somewhere down the road! </p><br/><br/><br/><br/>', 'image_id' => 42],

Keep Reading!', 'excerpt' => 'Here are the non-negotiable things you should do if you want to leave with the warm and fuzzies instead of hurt feelings or, worse, a broken heart.', 'body' => '<p>Just as it can be terrifying to take the leap of faith and ask that special someone you know out on a date, the dating world itself can be a nightmare if you don\'t know how to approach it. The vulnerability and exposed feelings that come with the dating process can make even the most confident suitors weak in the knees; truth be told, none of us like being judged or rejected. Even still, interacting with and building relationships with others on an intimate level is a critical part of the human experience, and, thus, dating is necessary even if it\'s hard and, at times, frustrating. </p><br/><p>It is often noted that first impressions are hugely influential, and starting on the right foot can make the uneasy process of dating a whole lot more bearable (and effective!). The first date is, therefore, not only the most anxiety-inducing but is also the best chance you have at hopefully securing many more dates down the road. We all have unique preferences when it comes to the world of first dates, but here are the non-negotiable things you should do if you want to leave with the warm and fuzzies instead of hurt feelings or, worse, a broken heart. </p><br/><h2>Chose Your Location Wisely </h2><br/><p>Selecting the right setting for your first date can make or break how it will go. Choosing a location that is comfortable, fun for both of you, and doesn\'t leave you feeling stuck there will go a long way towards starting things off on the right foot. The date should be light-hearted and fun, so you have to choose a setting that you feel you can be yourself in. </p><br/><h2>Show Up Early</h2><br/><p>A surefire way to set the wrong tone is to show up late to your first date. It not only will leave the other party anxious and wondering if you will show up, but also will likely mean that you arrive rushed and apologizing. This is not ideal. Showing up a few minutes early squashes any potential anxiety of racing the clock and allows you a few moments to gather yourself before the date starts. </p><br/><h2>Balance Style And Comfort </h2><br/><p>Showing up to your date in a tee shirt and gym shorts might be comfortable, but it doesn\'t exactly show that you are taking the opportunity seriously. Respect yourself enough to show up presentable and use it as an opportunity to express your style. Don\'t go too overboard, though, or you risk being uncomfortable and stuffy. </p><br/><h2>Keep It Light</h2><br/><p>It\'s safe to say that nerves will be high on both sides. After all, you are just meeting someone to explore a relationship, that can be a lot of pressure! To keep tension low and the authenticity high, keep your conversations light. Avoid confrontation or sensitive subjects, but be sure to ask a lot of questions. The date shouldn\'t just be about you. </p><br/><p>Following the tips above will ensure that you start on the right foot. The prospect of screwing up a first date that would have otherwise lead to something more is real, and so teeing yourself up for success is something you owe to yourself and your date. Lastly, try not to put your date on a pedestal. There is plenty of fish in the sea, and so spending your time on something that wasn\'t meant to only set you up for disappointment. </p><br/><p>Best of luck and go get\'em, tiger! </p>', 'image_id' => 43],

Here are the best strategies for maximizing your winning chances!', 'excerpt' => 'We can\'t guarantee that following this advice will have you dancing with lady luck, but sticking to these guidelines will undoubtedly go a long way towards improving your odds!', 'body' => '<p>It is no secret that the majority of gamblers who flock to the flashing lights of the Vegas Strip every year leave with less money than they are expecting. The electric, never-sleep energy of the many casinos is contagious, the casino floor a mecca for those looking to strike rich and beat the house at their own game. For the select few guests, this dream will become a reality, of which their success stories will stoke the enthusiasm for future guests down the line. The reality is that the hope of finding fortune remains for many, regardless of the number of those that fell short.</p><br/><br/><p>Are you planning to test your luck in Vegas? If so, there are some things you should know. We can\'t guarantee that following this advice will have you dancing with lady luck, but sticking to these guidelines will undoubtedly go a long way towards improving your odds! </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Keep Your Cards At Home</h2><br/><p>The only feeling worse than losing in the casinos is to leave having blown money you couldn\'t afford to lose. Unfortunately, most gamblers tend to chase their losses with the flawed thinking that, \"eventually I\'ll run into some luck and win it all back.\" Going down this road is a slippery slope, as the panic of losing more than you planned can fuel some gamblers into really putting it all on the line. The best way to prevent this is to establish a hard limit to your spending before you get sucked into the intoxicating lights and sounds. Bring only cash and leave your credit cards at home. Use your hotel safe as a makeshift bank for your trip, and withdraw only a portion with you on each trip to the casino floor. </p><br/><br/><h2>Learn When to Walk Away</h2><br/><p>Learning when to count your chips and take a break can make the difference between leaving Vegas a winner or a loser. If you find yourself up by a meaningful amount, consider picking up your chips and taking a break. Logic says that if you stay at any one table or machine long enough you will eventually lose, so knowing when to call it, even for just a moment, is a crucial skill. Likewise, if you find yourself losing a few hands in a row, recognize that it may not be your deck! Most players find that their luck comes in streaks, and so knowing how to recognize a losing streak and calling it before bad gets worse is an equally valuable skill. </p><br/><br/><h2>Play games with the best odds </h2><br/><p>Most casino games will give the house an advantage. The size of this advantage differs for each game, and so playing the games with the best odds can make a huge difference in your results. In general, the best games are ones that allow you to play against other gamblers as opposed to the house. Poker is extremely popular for this reason, but be sure you know the rules or it might not be such an advantage after all! On the flip side, games that are solely reliant on chance, such as slot machines, are the worst strategy and leave you totally at the casino\'s mercy. (or lack thereof!)</p><br/><br/><h2>Don\'t drink too much! </h2><br/><p>The easiest way to shoot yourself in the foot while gambling in Vegas is to take advantage of the seemingly endless free drinks that are offered. It\'s been said that nothing in life is free, and this holds especially true in Vegas! It may feel like you are getting the upper hand by taking advantage of free drinks, but understand that the intoxication that follows will likely mean you end up losing more than the drinks were even worth. If it\'s too good to be true in Vegas, it probably is, and the free drinks are no exception. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>There you have it, four crucial guidelines you should follow if you want to maximize your odds (and your fun!) while you are gambling in Vegas. Remember that vacation should be enjoyable, and a trip to \"The Strip\" is no different. Trying your luck at the casinos is an essential part of any Vegas experience and can be fun even if you don\'t leave a winner, just don\'t let the flashing lights get the best of you and your wallet! </p>', 'image_id' => 44],

Sending out dozens of applications with your resume, only to not hear back, is one of the most discouraging feelings you can have. With such a vulnerable process, it\'s no wonder that finding a new job can be dreadful that most would rather continue with something they don\'t enjoy than find a better fit. </p><br/><br/><p>With all of the stress and uncertainty that comes with job hunting, it should go without saying that setting yourself up with the best odds for success is worth the effort upfront. The resume you submit when you apply to a new job is the critical lynchpin that determines if you move forward in the hiring process. With job openings often receiving dozens, if not hundreds of applications, it\'s critically important that your resume stands out and presents you in the best possible light. </p><br/><br/><p>Here\'s a proven blueprint I\'ve used to secure tons of interviews in the past. Following these guidelines leaves you in the perfect position to score interviews and eventually find the job of your dreams. </p><br/><br/><h2>Format Correctly</h2><br/><p>You have a lot of creative freedom to format your resume however you like. The truth is there are many good approaches to presenting the information that\'ll get your foot in the door. Here\'s something to keep in mind, though. You want to choose a layout that maximizes the space you have to sell yourself without it looking cluttered. If your resume looks like a challenge to read, chances are the hiring manager will continue through their stack without giving you a real consideration. </p><br/><br/><h2>Highlight What Matters</h2><br/><p>When you are listing your experience, it\'s smart to list only the most relevant experience you\'ve had for the position you are applying for. Stick to two or three jobs you held for a meaningful amount of time, and use the extra space to elaborate more thoroughly on how you added value. </p><br/><br/><h2>Use Action Words</h2><br/><p>Action words are what display your assets most clearly. By sticking to an action word as the first word in every bullet point, you commit yourself to best explaining the tangible experience you have. If you have specific numbers or results, make sure to include them! They signal that you are paying attention and are goal-oriented. </p><br/><br/><h2>Spend Time On Your Objective</h2><br/><p>Most resume templates you find online will give you space for an objective. Many will gloss over this section; they write some words but fail to deliver anything with a punch. Clearly stating why you are looking for new opportunities and what those opportunities are, fills in the blanks for hiring managers, and paints a picture of you before you arrive for the interview. Keep this section simple and straight forward, but heavy on the passion and honesty. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>By following these resume guidelines, you will set yourself up for success when it comes time to seek out new career opportunities. The elephant in the hiring room is that, often, more resumes are coming in available position than whoever is hiring has time to sort through. The difference between getting your foot in the door for an interview and being dismissed preemptively can come down to how effectively you sell yourself on your resume. Spend the extra time setting yourself up for success, and you will reap the benefits! </p>', 'image_id' => 45],

For some of us, though, what always starts as a fun night routinely becomes a slippery slope that leads to hangovers, hurt feelings, and often much worse. Chances are if you are someone that should not be drinking, you know it. The consequences often start harmless, if not a little embarrassing, but can quickly spiral out of control until you are stuck and wondering what to do.</p><br/><br/><p>The biggest issue is that for most problem drinkers, the habit has become the answer to at least one of their problems in life. Making a habit change away from an activity that has been used as a crutch, especially over long periods, requires a disciplined commitment to changing your life. As someone that at one point had a problem with alcohol, I understand as well as anyone just how difficult it can be. Luckily, I have had the issue under control for a number of years thanks to a few strategies that allowed me to rid myself of this difficult-to-kick habit. Here\'s what has worked well for me and allowed me to get my life back. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Find A Replacement Hobby</h2><br/><p>The biggest issue I had with cutting alcohol out of my life is that I had used it to solve so many things I deemed as problematic. If I was anxious, bored, or just looking to have a good time, alcohol was the first thing that I looked to for entertainment. When I left the booze behind, finding a hobby that filled this void for me was critical to my ability to keep the liquid temptation in the rearview. For me, it was running and CrossFit; they both allowed me to burn off extra steam and gave me something to do when I had spare time on my hands. </p><br/><br/><h2>Embrace Those That Embrace The New You</h2><br/><p>When you make a significant change in your life, especially one that will change parts of your personality, some of your friends will inevitably be more supportive than others. Unfortunately, for some people having a friend that is always a little drunker and more embarrassing than them is the best reason they have to keep someone around.

Having a go-to non-alcoholic drink, you can have in your hand will limit how many people tempt you with a cold one. Find something you enjoy sipping on and enjoy knowing that you are making the best decision for your health. </p><br/><br/><h2>Don\'t Forget To Look Back </h2><br/><p>When you make a significant change like cutting alcohol out of your life, especially if it has been negative in your past, you will run into growing pains that make you wonder if it was all worth it. In these moments, it\'s important to not only reflect on how much better you feel physically, but also to realize how bad things could have gotten had you not put yourself first. Take stock in how much less dramatic and chaotic your life is, and you will know it\'s not worth trying to reintroduce it. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Giving up alcohol is hard; there is no question about it. To find success, you will have to shift your lifestyle and commit to seeing it through even when times get tough, and the temptation gets real. By sticking to the strategies above, you give yourself the best shot at keeping this bad habit behind you. Stay strong and keep moving forward, progress is better than perfection, and if you stay true to the course and committed to bettering yourself, it will get easier over time.

The reality is that interviews are not only critical for your career growth, and potentially for paying your rent, but they also leave us vulnerable to be judged by someone who\'s opinion we care about. Further, arriving for an interview nervous can be a read flag to potential employers, leaving them wondering why you don\'t have the confidence they are likely looking for from their new hire. </p><br/><br/><p>Having interviewed myself to dozens of jobs, some successful and others a total failure, I have learned that there are a few strategies that, when used, consistently have me walking in with confidence, nailing the interview, and landing the job. The strategies below will have you feeling confident and ready before you walk in, setting you up for success and, hopefully, a long break before you have to endure one again. </p><br/><br/><h2>Scout The Location </h2><br/><p>One of the biggest anxieties I had while interviewing for a new job was as simple as not being able to find it easily. This often-overlooked detail of interviewing can leave you showing up frazzled and stressed out at best, or, even worse, late. To avoid these potential day-ruiners, make sure you scout out the location of your interview ahead of time. Not only does this give you an idea about the potential commute before you commit to sitting down with them, but it also allows you to arrive with as much focus as possible. </p><br/><br/><h2>Get There Early</h2><br/><p>Arriving a few minutes early will give you the chance to collect yourself before you walk in. They say first impressions are everything, so showing up hurried or otherwise stressed can be a red flag that you may not be responsible. Use the few extra minutes you have to use the bathroom, go over your resume one last time, or restudy the job description so you feel as prepared as possible. </p><br/><br/><h2>Be Prepared </h2><br/><p>Showing up to an interview with a few copies of your resume gives you the appearance of someone that is taking the opportunity seriously and has confidence in their qualifications. Having multiple copies signals that you go above and beyond to make sure you have what you need, which can go a long way with the hiring manager. If the position may require things like a writing sample or copy of past work, having these things on hand can speed up the process and reduce the risk that someone else gets the job while you are out gathering what you need. </p><br/><br/><h2>Don\'t Put Your Eggs In One Basket</h2><br/><p>Desperation is an ugly scent, and this is especially true with hiring. Come across as too dependent on landing the job, and you may create more questions instead of inspiring confidence. Realize before you sit down for the interview that whether or not you land the job is not the end of the world, and take a bit of the pressure off. You will come across more natural and confident, giving you a better chance of being the one that is hired for the position. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Nailing your next job interview comes down to being prepared. In reality, you can only prepare to an extent, but by doing what you can, you give yourself the best possible opportunity to be presented in a good light. The interview process is not something most people enjoy, but the ones that are best at it are the ones that approach it correctly. Follow these tips, and you will nail your next interview, leaving you to wonder why you ever were so worried in the first place. </p>', 'image_id' => 47],

Do you set multiple alarms to ensure that you can eventually peel yourself from under the covers, only to trudge through your morning unenthusiastic and wanting to go back to bed?</p><br/><br/><p>If this sounds like you, I can honestly say I relate. For most of my adult life, mornings were the bain of my existence. I hated them. By the time lunch came, I had usually pulled myself out of it, but my lack of excitement for the first quarter of my day left me enviously yearning for the go-get-em attitude of some of my coworkers and friends. </p><br/><br/><p>After decades of struggle, in the last year I have committed my focus towards establishing a routine that will help me win the morning. The process I am going to share has taken a lot of trial and error, but the routine that came out of it is now one of the most significant assets I have and one that\'s hard to deviate from. </p><br/><br/><br/><p>Here is how I\'ve managed to win the morning! </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Have A Plan Written Out </h2><br/><p>The anxiety of wondering where to start with the day\'s tasks is the last thing I want when I am just starting my day. By creating a list the night before of the important things I have to do, or any places I have to be, I can quickly reference my priorities and not worry about forgetting something while my brain is still powering up for the day. </p><br/><br/><h2>Give Yourself Time</h2><br/><p>It\'s hard to believe waking up earlier can help you be more productive in the morning, but bear with me. By giving yourself extra time to get the ball rolling for the day, you avoid the stress of feeling like you are in a rush from the moment you get up. I am not advocating less sleep here, only that you wake up with enough time to get your day started at your own pace. Going to bed a little earlier the night before can make up this difference! </p><br/><br/><h2>Let Your Technology Stay Asleep </h2><br/><p>By avoiding your tech gadgets as you are first waking up, you allow yourself to take priority in the morning and move at your speed. Perhaps check your phone for emergency messages if you\'d otherwise have anxiety, but texting, email, and social media should wait until you are ready for it. By setting aside time for yourself and avoiding distractions, you can focus on doing what you need to do for yourself first. </p><br/><br/><h2>See The Light</h2><br/><p>When you wake up, throw on a sweater or jacket and take a few steps outside. The sunlight (or maybe even sunrise) will awaken your brain and signal the chemicals that get your day time processes moving. The fresh air feels great, and the temperature outside will let you know how to dress for the day. Start by taking ten deep breaths. </p><br/><br/><h2>Fuel Your Day</h2><br/><p>I have found that drinking a big glass of water first thing in the morning has a hugely beneficial effect on my day. It allows me to start off on the right foot regarding my hydration and wakes up my insides to let them know that the time for rest has been put on hold. Make sure to eat a light, nutritious breakfast that will be your first fuel source for the day. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>If you struggle with winning the morning and often find yourself slogging through the first hours of your day, give the above suggestions a shot. As with any routine in life, you will have to test and try different things to find what resonates with you the most and has you feeling your best. Stay committed in your pursuit of finding what works for you in the morning, and you will quickly realize that the morning is the best time of the day! </p>', 'image_id' => 48],

This may sound harsh but stick with me. The truth is that people immediately pick up on your self confidence, and usually will believe what you are inadvertently telling them. Arrogance aside, if you have nothing going for you, it\'s pretty easy to say that. Does that sound like someone you\'d be interested in? Me either. Spend the time and energy to focus on yourself first and recreate yourself. Find things you are passionate about and build on some interests. You\'ll walk around with your head held a little higher, which can make all the difference. </p><br/><br/><h2>Immerse Yourself In Your Passions</h2><br/><p>Get involved with something positive that brings you joy. This could be anything from volunteering at the Humane Society to joining a community gym.

See where I\'m going with this? </p><br/><br/><h2>Be Open To New People</h2><br/><p>You never know when you may be shaking the hand of your future soulmate. If you are closed off and shy, you might miss your opportunity entirely. Keep an open mind and give people a shot at getting to know you! You might surprise yourself! </p><br/><br/><h2>Start Slow, Build Relationship </h2><br/><p>When you find someone you connect with and are interested in getting to know better, be sure not to try and move too fast. Genuine connection takes time to build, and coming across as desperate or eager to rush things will more often than not have you falling on your face. Keep things slow and enjoy the process, with any luck, it\'ll be the last time you do this! </p><br/><br/><br/><p>In today\'s society, finding a long term partner is more complicated than it\'s ever been. The dating apps that are meant to bring convenience to the process have, in my mind, cheapened the process and given the impression that instant gratification is possible. By taking the time to do things the right way (as it\'s always been done!), you stand a much better chance of finding that special someone! </p>', 'image_id' => 49],

In reflecting back, there were some things I did right, as well as some things I definitely could have done better in my efforts to navigate the move smoothly and headache-free. </p><br/><br/><p>Here are the biggest lessons I learned.</p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Get A Head Start</h2><br/><p>The ugly truth is that your move is probably going to take a lot more time and energy than you are expecting. Even moving out of a small studio without a ton of furniture, I found myself spending many more hours than I had initially budgeted. A first glance led me to believe I would have some furniture and a few boxes, nothing that couldn\'t be packed up in a couple of hours and loaded into a Uhaul for a single trip. What I neglected to see was the unorganized mess of places like my junk drawer and bathroom vanity. There are likely several \"spots\" in your house that have collected things you don\'t even remember having! Starting to pack these spaces up well in advance will save you the last second scramble later. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Find A Fresh Start</h2><br/><p>Not only should you start packing well in advance, but using that time as the opportunity to tidy up your life can be as time and headache saving as it is empowering. I don\'t know exactly how many bags I brought to Goodwill for donation, but I do remember it was multiple carloads. All of that out of a studio apartment! The truth is that we all accumulate stuff, whether we realize it or not. Perhaps those things had some significance or meaning at the time, but I would be willing to bet that you could go without most of it. A good rule of thumb that I used was that if it cost less than 20 dollars and I forgot I had it and/or hadn\'t used it in over a year, I got rid of it. A few months later and I couldn\'t even tell you most of what I got rid of... it was that (un)important. </p><br/><br/><br/><h2>Start Cleaning Early</h2><br/><p>I fall somewhere on the spectrum between neat freak and average in terms of cleanliness. I\'ve never been one to live in a pigsty and generally keep up with my cleaning chores. Because of this, I expected that my apartment would be relatively painless to put back into the kind of shape that allowed me to get my full security deposit back. Boy, was I wrong. Chores like wiping the baseboards and scrubbing the bathtub are in and of themselves not backbreakers, but lumped together they created many hours of additional cleaning that I didn\'t see coming. In retrospect, had I started a lot of those projects sooner, I would have been a lot more efficient when it came time to moving out. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>I plan to follow these moving tips diligently the next time I am moving someplace new. Moving is often the sign of better times and new opportunities ahead and, thus, it shouldn\'t be dreaded! By planning and using it as an opportunity to better yourself, you can avoid moving headaches and, perhaps, even find some enjoyment in it. </p><br/><br/><p>Don\'t forget to lift with your legs and not your back!</p><br/><br/>', 'image_id' => 50],

In addition to the day-to-day symptoms that present with COPD, it can also cause additional risk in the long term by increasing the risk of even more severe conditions, including pneumonia, heart attack, and lung cancer.

Symptoms often present day to day, but those suffering from COPD may also experience them to an increasing level at specific periods, known as exacerbations.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wheezing</li>\r\n<li>Shortness of breath, especially when active</li>\r\n<li>Mucus buildup in the lungs that regularly necessitate clearing of the throat</li>\r\n<li>Chronic mucus-producing cough</li>\r\n<li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>\r\n<li>Low energy, even after rest</li>\r\n<li>Swelling of the legs, ankles, and/or feet <sup>4</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What To Do If You Think You May Suffer From COPD</h2>\r\n<p>If you identify with the risk factors and symptoms listed above, you must reach out to your doctor and request more information. Because COPD can get worse over time, it is essential to get a head start on a diagnosis and treatment plan. There are several lifestyle changes you can make that could mitigate the symptoms and effects of COPD, as well as a variety of both short and long term treatments that could be available to you.</p>\r\n<p>Often, bronchodilators are prescribed as a short-acting treatment and work to loosen tight muscles in the lungs that could be causing some symptoms. Also, more long-acting dilators called corticosteroids can be used if symptoms are initially improved with the bronchodilators. Antibiotics and antivirals are often prescribed to treat complications stemming from COPD, including pneumonia. Lastly, a variety of vaccines can be utilized to help mitigate the risks of living with COPD, including annually for influenza, as well as a pneumococcal vaccine. <sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Living with COPD can present a number of debilitating symptoms, as well as cause additional risk for further complications. As we get older, our risk for COPD increases, which means that keeping a close eye on your health and monitoring periodically for the risk factors and symptoms of COPD can help you identify it early. Modern medicine has created a number of treatments for COPD that allow those who suffer from it to live longer and with fewer symptoms, but, like most aspects of our health, early intervention is critical for the long term management of the disease.</p>\r\n<p>If you feel you are currently living with COPD or have a particularly high risk of developing it in the future, you must consult a doctor. Regardless, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and staying active and free from regular smoke or particle inhalation can go a long way to preventing the disease altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"citations\">[1] <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd\" target=\"_blank\">Learn About COPD</a> [2] <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83163/\" target=\"_blank\">Chronic Lung Disease</a> [3] <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679\" target=\"_blank\">COPD</a> [4] <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/exacerbation-symptoms-and-warning-signs\" target=\"_blank\">COPD Exacerbation</a> [5] <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/copd#treatment\" target=\"_blank\">COPD Treatment</a></p>\r\n', 'image_id' => 152],

Teeth are integral to so much of our daily lives, from showcasing our personality and confidence when we smile to making it possible to enjoy our favorite meals fully. It&rsquo;s no wonder that individuals have always looked for the best solutions when it comes to replacing teeth.</p>\r\n<cta-1 domain=\"gain-a-dentalimplantsaid.fyi\" :terms=\"[\'Dental implant cost\',\'Oral Surgeons Near Me\',\'Dental Implant Alternatives\',\'Dental Implant Procedure \']\"></cta-1>\r\n<p>Luckily, in the last 30 years, there has been a surge in the popularity and success of dental implants, the new and most effective way to reclaim the full functionality of your teeth. Currently, over 3 million individuals are living with dental implants in the United States alone, and that number grows by up to 500,000 per year. In this article, we hope to paint a detailed picture of this revolutionary procedure so that you can decide if it is right for you. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<img class=\"hidden-desktop\" src=\"https://efflux.com/images/Dentist_Choosing_Crown_Dental_Implants.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;\" />\r\n<h2>What Are Dental Implants</h2>\r\n<p>Dental implants can be thought of as the most reliable, durable option when it comes to securing new replacement teeth. The implants themselves are not teeth at all, but rather are artificial fasteners for meant to mimic the extraordinary strength of natural tooth roots. The implant is surgically fixed directly into the jawbone of the patient, where it then sits for upwards of a few months to set and fuse with the bone properly. This process is called osseointegration and allows the roots, and eventually, the adjoined tooth, to be self-supported and, therefore, not affect other nearby teeth. The artificial tooth that connects to the dental implant is known as a crown, which is custom made to match the individual\'s other remaining teeth and mouth. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Who Are Dental Implants For?</h2>\r\n<p>Dental implants are considered the gold standard option for anyone who has lost one or more teeth and is looking for a long term replacement solution. Dental implants are especially popular among older people who may have lost their teeth due to decay or gum disease. In the past, dentures have traditionally been used. Still, the vast majority of people much prefer the durability and permanency of implants as opposed to the inconvenience of relying on teeth, which are removable and potentially challenging to manage. Further, many people report that their ability to taste and enjoy their favorite foods fully is diminished with dentures, which is not the case with dental implants. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Advantages Of Dental Implants</h2>\r\n<p>There are several distinct advantages to choosing dental implants over other options, such as dentures or a cemented crown option. The most obvious benefit of having dental implants is the fact that they are permanent. The potential for undesired movement of dentures often creates problems for individuals when it comes to speech and eating. These issues should not only be considered at face value; additionally, there is a risk of lower self-confidence and self-esteem resulting from the lack of predictability with dentures.</p>\r\n<p>Further, dental implants are considered to be more comfortable and low maintenance because they are permanent and don&rsquo;t have to be removed. Also, implants allow for improved oral health because they are specifically created to fit in the mouth without causing crowding or requiring that other teeth be affected. In this sense, the extra space from a lack of overcrowding allows for all teeth to be maintained and cleaned more effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, dental implants have a better ability to mimic your teeth. When done by a professional, they not only look better but give the feel of actual teeth. Most individuals who get dental implants report feeling more confident to live their life as they usually would, no longer hindered by self-esteem issues and the fear that they may not be able to always rely on their dentures or cemented crowns. <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Dental Implant Procedure &amp; Recovery Time</h2>\r\n<p>If you are interested in getting dental implants, you&rsquo;ll quickly realize that there is a bit of a process of doing so. The first step is to seek out a dentist who is trained in oral surgery and specifically in restorative dentistry. They will provide an initial consultation and, if you collectively decide that implants are the best option, will move forward with creating an individualized treatment plan.</p>\r\n<p>The first step of the procedure involves the implant placement, which will mimic a natural tooth&rsquo;s roots. The implant, a titanium piece of metal similar to a small screw, is placed into the missing tooth&rsquo;s bone socket in the jawbone. The implant is then left alone as it heals and fuses, with the jawbone eventually growing around the implant and securing it permanently. This process typically takes between 2 and 3 months.</p>\r\n<p>The next step is for a small connection piece, called an abutment, to be fastened to the implant. This abutment is what will connect and bridge the new crown (artificial tooth) to its respective implant.</p>\r\n<p>The last step is for the dentist to create the new replacement crowns for you individually. Matching the color and using a bite impression to model your perfect crown accurately, the dentist has the teeth designed uniquely for you. These are then attached to the abutment, completing the process and giving you the function and appearance of a brand new mouthful of teeth! <sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Cost Estimate For Dental Implants</h2>\r\n<p>The cost for dental implants can vary significantly depending on the number of implants needed and the underlying condition of your jawbone, gums, and other adjacent teeth. Unfortunately, dental implants are not covered by most medical or dental plans, which opt for less expensive solutions like dentures. Implants for individual teeth can range in cost from $1,500 to $6,000, depending mainly on the external factors that were just mentioned. For an entire mouth, implants can often range between $30,000 and $50,000. The high costs associated with implants are primarily to the medical expenses of a dentist and also of receiving anesthesia. It&rsquo;s important to remember when considering costs that implants require multiple procedures, thus driving up the price. <sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Dental implants can be a game-changer for those who are looking for a more permanent, reliable, and great-looking solution when it comes to replacing lost teeth. The procedure itself and the costs associated can be a barrier to entry for some; however, the results that come of it are considered by most who go through with it to be worth the price. If you are looking for a long term solution to missing teeth, dental solutions are indeed the gold standard. It&rsquo;s no wonder over 3 million Americans have opted for the procedure, and many thousands more are joining them every month.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"citations\">[1] <a href=\"https://www.aaid-implant.org/dental-implants/what-are-dental-implants/\" target=\"_blank\">What are Dental Implants</a> [2] <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439679/\" target=\"_blank\">Implants</a> [3] <a href=\"https://www.rochesteradvanceddentistry.com/blog/dental-implants-much-better-for-eating-than-traditional-dentures/\" target=\"_blank\">Dental Implants: Much Better for Eating Than Traditional Dentures</a> [4] <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-implants#1\" target=\"_blank\">Dental Implants</a> [5] <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/dental-implant-surgery/about/pac-20384622\" target=\"_blank\">Dental implant surgery</a> [6] <a href=\"https://southlanddentalcare.com/full-mouth-dental-implants-cost-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\">How much should you pay for full mouth dental implants?</a></p>\r\n', 'image_id' => 151],

Signs And Symptoms To Look For', 'excerpt' => 'What Is Psoriasis? Signs And Symptoms To Look For', 'body' => '<p>Psoriasis is a relatively common but potentially severe autoimmune response disorder that causes the skin cells to replicate many times faster than average. Psoriasis leads to an excess buildup of dry, dead skin that manifests as red patches (similar to a rash) and sometimes with itchy, white scales. It should be recognized that there are five main types of psoriasis, each with unique presenting signs and symptoms. This article will address those presenting differences below. Psoriasis typically develops in individuals between the ages of 15 and 35 but can continue to progress throughout life. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<cta-1 domain=\"a-snag-psoriasistreatment.zone\" :terms=\"[\'Psoriasis Treatments\',\'Dermatologist Near Me\',\'Scalp Psoriasis Treatments\',\'Living With Psoriasis\']\"></cta-1>\r\n<p>Globally, about 125 million people worldwide are affected, with over 8 million diagnosed in the United States alone, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium. Similar to Eczema, psoriasis is a chronic disease that is prone to flare-ups, meaning that symptoms are likely to present more severely at certain times. The affected skin patches vary in size, ranging from small spots the size of a penny to major outbreaks that can cover large areas of the body. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>While there is currently not a known cure for psoriasis, it is important to understand that a diagnosis does not mean you are helpless. There is a variety of both long and shorter-term treatments (including both prescription and homeopathic) that can reduce the severity of presenting symptoms as well as the frequency of flare-ups.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s crucial that you understand the different types of psoriasis to look for and how those symptoms will likely present themselves. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<img src=\"https://efflux.com/images/man_checking_scalp_for_psoriasis.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;\" />\r\n<h2>Signs And Symptoms Of Psoriasis Types</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, there are a total of five more specific diagnoses that fall under the blanket term psoriasis. Although many people only suffer from a single type of psoriasis, it&rsquo;s important to fully consider the symptoms of each type, as some individuals do have more than one type simultaneously.</p>\r\n<h3>Plaque Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>This is by far the most common form of psoriasis, with between 80 and 90% of total cases falling under this variation according to Healthline. The most notable symptom for plaque psoriasis is the commonly recognized red skin patches or lesions that can often be covered with white or silver scales. Usually, these patches present as itchy, or even painful, and can appear anywhere on the body. Cases of plaque psoriasis are also occasionally documented on the inside of the mouth. Outbreaks vary in size and can appear anywhere from a few small, localized patches to a more severe outbreak, including many plaque sites. <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Guttate Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>Commonly triggered by bacterial infections (most commonly strep throat), guttate psoriasis presents differently than the more common plaque psoriasis in that the lesions are much smaller and less pronounced. They are often shaped in small spots, sometimes shaped like drops of liquid, and most often appear on the legs, torso, arms, or scalp. Guttate psoriasis is the most likely type to affect children and young adults. <sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Inverse Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>Inverse psoriasis is most commonly found in places of the body that are more prone to friction from rubbing or sweating. These areas include areas under the genitals, breasts, or armpits. Sometimes less commonly identified than plaque psoriasis, inverse psoriasis presents differently in the sense that, instead of a thick, layered plaque buildup seen in other types, the rash is usually smooth. The infection can be quite severe and is thought to be triggered commonly as a result of fungal infections. <sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Pustular Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>Pustular psoriasis is a severe type that spreads quickly and can present in either small, localized areas or more broadly. Often found on the hands and feet, pustular psoriasis takes the appearance of blisters filled with pus and can appear and recede in very short time frames. The pustules (blisters) contain a yellow or off white colored puss that is white blood cells as a result of the immune response. This type of psoriasis is more rarely seen than most other types and has a unique set of potential symptoms that includes fever, chills, and even diarrhea. <sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Erythrodermic Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>Erythrodermic psoriasis is the least common of the types, accounting for less than 3 percent of all diagnosed cases of psoriasis. More similar in appearance to a burn than the plaque buildups associated with some of the more common types, erythrodermic psoriasis is usually considered to be more severe when considering the presenting symptoms. The skin of an individual suffering from this type will often look bright red and burned, appearing in more significant rashes than the small scales associated with plaque psoriasis. Further complications, including swelling of the ankles and hands can occur from the body retaining fluids due to a decreased ability to maintain internal body temperature. The most severe cases can require hospitalization for everything from uncontrollable shivering to pneumonia and even heart failure. Triggers for this type of psoriasis include excessive long term alcohol consumption, adverse reactions to steroids like cortisone, or even sunburn. <sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\r\n<p>Psoriasis is a wide-ranging condition that can present with a number of different signs and symptoms depending on the specific type. It is important to consider the various specifics of each type; the severity, duration, and potential for spread are unique in each case. People of all ages should be aware of what to look for; age doesn&rsquo;t seem to play a huge role in aquiring the condition and most often initially presents in those under the age of 35. There are also a number of triggers and risk factors you should be familiar with, which you can find more information on right here at efflux.com. Psoriasis affects a significant number globally, and thus it is relatively likely that you or someone you care about may develop psoriasis or even already be living with it. As with anything in the medical realm, a broad understanding of the condition and what to look for often makes the difference being able to detect early and begin mitigation strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"citations\">\r\n[1] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/parents/about-psoriasis\">About psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in children</a>\r\n[2] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/content/statistics\">Psoriasis Statistics</a>\r\n[3] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355845\">Psoriasis Diagnosis and Treatment</a>\r\n[4] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/types/plaque\">About Psoriasis</a>\r\n[5] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/types/guttate\">Guttate Psoriasis</a>\r\n[6] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314259#symptoms\">Psoriasis Symptoms</a>\r\n[7] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314940#causes\">Pustular psoriasis: What you need to know</a>\r\n[8] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/types/erythrodermic\">Erythrodermic Psoriasis</a></p>', 'image_id' => 153],
